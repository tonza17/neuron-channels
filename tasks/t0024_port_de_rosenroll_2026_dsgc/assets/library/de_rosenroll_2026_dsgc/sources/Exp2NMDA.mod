COMMENT
Two state kinetic scheme synapse described by rise time tau1,
and decay time constant tau2. The normalized peak condunductance is 1.
Decay time MUST be greater than rise time.

The solution of A->G->bath with rate constants 1/tau1 and 1/tau2 is
 A = a*exp(-t/tau1) and
 G = a*tau2/(tau2-tau1)*(-exp(-t/tau1) + exp(-t/tau2))
	where tau1 < tau2

If tau2-tau1 -> 0 then we have a alphasynapse.
and if tau1 -> 0 then we have just single exponential decay.

The factor is evaluated in the
initial block such that an event of weight 1 generates a
peak conductance of 1.

Because the solution is a sum of exponentials, the
coupled equations can be solved as a pair of independent equations
by the more efficient cnexp method.

This is a modified version of the Exp2Syn.mod packaged with NEURON.
I have simply altered the calculation of g, so it incorporates the
voltage dependence as measured by Santhosh.

The local_v, Voff, and Vset are tricks I learned from the
bipolarNMDA.mod I received from Alon Poleg-Polsky. They allow for a
simple way to turn off the voltage dependence of the NMDA conductance.
