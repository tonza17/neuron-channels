# Brainstorm Session 3 — Per-Category Literature-Survey Wave

## Context

The project has completed its first two task waves:

* **Wave 1** (t0001-t0005): foundational brainstorm, DSGC-focused compartmental-model literature
  survey, simulator survey, canonical target tuning curve, baseline DSGC morphology download.
* **Wave 2** (t0007-t0013, planned by t0006): NEURON install (t0007 done), plus calibration,
  porting, visualisation, scoring, and provenance tasks (t0008-t0013 still in-flight or not
  started).

The paper corpus contains 20 DOIs from t0002 (DSGC compartmental models). Categories
`direction-selectivity`, `compartmental-modeling`, and `retinal-ganglion-cell` are already
well-covered by that survey. Five remaining categories are under-covered: `cable-theory`,
`dendritic-computation`, `patch-clamp`, `synaptic-integration`, `voltage-gated-channels`.

## Session Goal

Plan a per-category literature-survey wave (Wave 3) that broadens the paper corpus so the project's
research questions about Na/K conductance combinations, active-vs-passive dendrites, and synaptic
kinetics can be grounded in the wider neuroscience literature rather than only DSGC-specific work.

## Decisions

1. **Drop the 3 saturated categories** (direction-selectivity, compartmental-modeling,
   retinal-ganglion-cell). The existing t0002 corpus + queued t0010 (hunt missed DSGC models) cover
   them adequately.

2. **Create 5 new literature-survey tasks** (t0015-t0019), one per remaining category, each
   targeting ~25 category-relevant papers with cross-category overlap accepted (option (b) from the
   brainstorm discussion). Total attempted: ~125 papers, expected unique ~80-100 after cross-task
   dedup (addressed by a later dedup-checkpoint task).

3. **Exclude the 20-DOI t0002 corpus** from each new task's search to avoid wasting download budget
   on already-owned papers.

4. **Bump `project/budget.json` `total_budget` from $0 to $1** so the mechanical
   `has_external_costs: true` gate on the `literature-survey` task type does not block execution.
   Literal expected spend remains $0 (arXiv, PubMed Central, ModelDB, and open-access sources are
   free; summarisation is done in-session).

5. **Paywalled paper protocol**: each task lists paywalled DOIs in
   `intervention/paywalled_papers.md`; the researcher downloads PDFs manually from their
   institutional account into `assets/paper/<paper_id>/files/` and the task then upgrades
   `download_status` to `"success"` with a full summary in a follow-up pass.

## New Suggestions Produced

Five dataset-kind suggestions (S-0014-01 through S-0014-05), each `priority: high`, one per new
task. These are recorded in `results/suggestions.json` and become the `source_suggestion` for their
respective child task.

## Out of Scope

* No experiments this session — this is a planning-only brainstorm.
* No corrections — t0002 corpus is correct; we are extending, not correcting.
* No new asset types or task types — `literature-survey` already exists.
