# Brainstorm Results Session 1

## Objective

Run the first brainstorming session for the neuron-channels project, held immediately after
`/setup-project` completed. The goal is to translate `project/description.md` into a concrete first
wave of tasks that the researcher can execute autonomously.

## Context

The project is brand-new. After setup, the repository contains:

* `project/description.md` with five research questions about the electrophysiological basis of
  retinal direction selectivity, and success criteria centred on a modifiable compartmental model
  and a good fit to a target angle-to-AP-frequency tuning curve.
* `project/budget.json` with zero budget and no paid services.
* Eight project categories and four registered metrics (`tuning_curve_rmse` as the key metric).
* No existing tasks, suggestions, answers, or results.

## Session Outcome

The session produced four first-wave task folders, all with `status = not_started`:

* `t0002_literature_survey_dsgc_compartmental_models` — one broad literature survey covering all
  five research questions.
* `t0003_simulator_library_survey` — compare NEURON, NetPyNE, Brian2, MOOSE, Arbor, and pick a
  primary + backup simulator.
* `t0004_generate_target_tuning_curve` — analytically generate a canonical cosine-like target
  angle-to-AP-rate curve as the optimisation reference.
* `t0005_download_dsgc_morphology` — download a reconstructed DSGC morphology (depends on t0002).

T0002, t0003, and t0004 are independent and can run in parallel. T0005 waits on t0002's morphology
shortlist.

## Researcher Preferences Captured

* Target tuning curve will be simulated with a canonical cosine-like shape, not digitised from any
  published figure.
* The project will try several simulator libraries, not commit to NEURON alone up front.
* One big literature survey rather than several narrow ones.
* Autonomous execution; the researcher does not need to gate each task plan.
