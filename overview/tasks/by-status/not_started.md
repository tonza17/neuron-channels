# Download candidate DSGC morphology

## Motivation

Every downstream simulation task needs a concrete reconstructed morphology to load. Rather
than generating a synthetic branching structure, we want a published DSGC (or DSGC-like RGC)
reconstruction used by prior modelling work. The literature survey (t0002) produces the
shortlist; this task commits to one file.

## Scope

Download one reconstructed DSGC morphology in SWC format (or HOC / NeuroML if SWC is not
available) from a public source such as NeuroMorpho.org, ModelDB, or a paper's supplementary
materials. The morphology should be one of those flagged as suitable in t0002's answer asset.

## Approach

1. Read t0002's answer asset to pick the recommended morphology.
2. Download the file and verify it loads as a valid SWC / HOC structure.
3. Record its provenance (source URL, paper DOI, reconstruction protocol) in the dataset asset
   metadata.

## Expected Outputs

* One dataset asset under `assets/dataset/dsgc_baseline_morphology/` containing the morphology
  file(s) and metadata.

## Compute and Budget

No external cost.

## Dependencies

`t0002_literature_survey_dsgc_compartmental_models` — the literature survey produces the
morphology shortlist and rationale.

## Verification Criteria

* Dataset asset passes `verify_dataset_asset.py`.
* The asset's `details.json` links back to the source paper or NeuroMorpho record.
* The downloaded file loads without errors in at least one candidate simulator library.
