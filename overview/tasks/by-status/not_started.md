# CoreNEURON Vast.ai RTX 4090 Speedup Benchmark

## Source Suggestion

S-0033-01 (CoreNEURON Vast.ai RTX 4090 benchmark to validate or replace the assumed 5x speedup
in the t0033 cost model).

## Motivation

The t0033 planning task estimated a $50.54 central Vast.ai budget for the future joint DSGC
morphology + top-10 VGC DSI-maximisation optimiser. That estimate rests on an unvalidated
CoreNEURON-on-GPU-over-stock-CPU-NEURON speedup factor of 5x (91 s deterministic sim on RTX
4090 vs 456 s on single CPU core). The corpus documents Hines 1997 O(N) cable-solver scaling
but predates GPU NEURON variants, so the 5x figure is a literature-less guess that drives the
largest sensitivity-band column ($23–$119 under 0.5x–2x perturbations).

Brainstorm session 8 (t0040) considered offloading t0041–t0044 to Vast.ai to cut wall-clock,
and rejected that plan because the per-task compute is small and the 5x speedup is
unvalidated. This task directly addresses the validation gap: run a short, well-scoped Vast.ai
experiment that replaces the 5x assumption with a measured value and tightens (or widens) the
$23–$119 sensitivity band before the joint optimiser is commissioned.

This also exercises the project's Vast.ai provisioning workflow for the first time (total
project spend to date: $0.00 / $1.00), surfacing any setup issues before the far more
expensive t0033 optimiser run.

## Objective

Provision one Vast.ai RTX 4090 instance under the existing `setup-remote-machine` filters.
Build CoreNEURON against NEURON 8.2.7 with OpenACC / CUDA. Run the t0022 deterministic
12-angle x 10-trial protocol (same sim used in t0022 baseline) under:

1. Stock NEURON on CPU (single core).
2. CoreNEURON on GPU (RTX 4090).

Report wall-clock per sim, throughput (sims/hour), measured speedup factor, cost per sim in
USD at RTX 4090 Vast.ai rate, and a recommended replacement value for t0033's 5x assumption.
Produce one answer asset capturing the measured speedup and its implications for the t0033
cost envelope.

## Scope

* One Vast.ai RTX 4090 instance. Estimated wall-clock 1–3 h; estimated cost $2–5 at $0.50/h.
* Use t0022's `trial_runner` unchanged; do not modify biophysics or protocol.
* Match stock-NEURON and CoreNEURON runs trial-for-trial for apples-to-apples comparison.
* Record provisioning time and setup friction separately so the t0033 plan can budget for it.

## Out of Scope

* Multi-GPU scaling (t0033 assumes single-GPU).
* A100 / H100 benchmarks (cost column in t0033 already recomputes from measured RTX 4090
  speedup).
* CPU-96 many-core benchmark (t0033 already recommends ignoring that column).
* Any morphology or channel modifications (pure runtime benchmark).

## Deliverables

* `assets/answer/coreneuron-rtx4090-speedup-vs-stock-neuron/` — full answer asset with
  measured speedup, per-sim cost, and recommended t0033 budget update.
* `results/results_summary.md` and `results/results_detailed.md` with Methodology, Metrics,
  Comparison vs Baselines (5x assumption), and Next Steps.
* `results/metrics.json` with: `stock_neuron_s_per_sim`, `coreneuron_s_per_sim`,
  `speedup_factor`, `coreneuron_usd_per_sim`, `provisioning_minutes`, `setup_minutes`.
* `results/compare_literature.md` comparing the measured speedup to Hines 1997 cable-solver
  scaling expectations and any CoreNEURON GPU benchmarks found in the corpus.
* `results/suggestions.json` with at minimum a follow-up proposing a correction to t0033's
  answer asset if the measured speedup differs from 5x by more than 20%.
* `results/costs.json` and `results/remote_machines_used.json` with the full Vast.ai
  provisioning record.

## Anticipated Risks

* **Vast.ai provisioning may fail or block on verification**: the project has never
  provisioned a Vast.ai instance; the `setup-remote-machine` skill may hit unexpected
  friction. Budget extra time for first-run troubleshooting and record every setup step for
  future tasks.
* **CoreNEURON build may require NEURON 8.2.7 patch or a newer version**: if CoreNEURON does
  not build cleanly against the project's NEURON version, document the workaround or flag the
  task as intervention_blocked rather than silently bumping the NEURON version.
* **Deterministic-reproducibility caveat**: stock NEURON on CPU and CoreNEURON on GPU may not
  produce bit-identical spike trains due to floating-point ordering differences; report the
  max-spike-time-deviation and any DSI delta explicitly so the t0033 optimiser knows whether
  GPU and CPU runs are substitutable.
* **Cost overrun**: hard-cap the instance runtime at 3 hours. If the benchmark cannot finish
  within the cap, post-mortem the provisioning and setup overhead and re-scope before a second
  attempt.

## Verification Criteria

* `measured_speedup_factor` is reported with both mean and 95% CI.
* `coreneuron_usd_per_sim` is reported at the actual Vast.ai instance rate at runtime (not the
  snapshot rate from t0033).
* At least one answer asset is produced per the answer specification.
* If the measured speedup differs from 5x by more than 20%, a correction-proposal suggestion
  is filed in `results/suggestions.json` against t0033's answer asset.

# Fetch Paywalled Morphology Papers: Kim2014 and Sivyer2013

## Motivation

During t0027 (literature survey on computational modeling of cell morphology effects on
direction selectivity), two papers that met the inclusion criteria could not be retrieved
through the normal open-access and Sheffield institutional routes:

* **Kim et al. 2014** — flagged as intervention in t0027 when the direct download chain
  failed; the paper is relevant because it builds a compartmental model tying distal dendritic
  geometry to DS outcome.
* **Sivyer et al. 2013** — paywalled on J Physiol, Sheffield SSO did not recognise the DOI at
  the time; highly relevant because it grounds the dendritic-spike branch-independence
  mechanism that t0029 will discriminate against Dan2018 passive-TR.

A dedicated task with explicit intervention allowance (manual SSO retry, inter-library-loan,
or corresponding-author email) is the clean path to complete the literature coverage. Source
suggestion **S-0027-06** (medium priority).

## Scope

1. For each of the two papers, attempt retrieval in order: open-access via pdf_url → Sheffield
   institutional SSO → ResearchGate / author website → inter-library loan →
   corresponding-author email.
2. If one or more retrieval paths fail, create an intervention file documenting what was tried
   and what is still needed (human follow-up).
3. When a PDF is obtained, add the paper as a standard paper asset under
   `tasks/t0031_fetch_paywalled_morphology_papers/assets/paper/<paper_id>/` following
   `meta/asset_types/paper/specification.md` — `details.json` + canonical summary document +
   `files/<filename>.pdf`.
4. Summarise each paper with full detail per the spec (including all 9 mandatory sections in
   the summary).

## Approach

* Local Windows workstation. No remote compute, no paid API.
* The `/add-paper` skill (if present) handles the mechanical download + summary workflow.
  Otherwise follow the paper asset specification manually.
* If any PDF cannot be retrieved after all attempts, mark `download_status: "failed"` in
  `details.json` with a detailed `download_failure_reason`, and keep the metadata +
  abstract-only summary for searchability.

## Expected Outputs

* 2 paper assets under `assets/paper/<paper_id>/`, each with `details.json`, the canonical
  summary document, and `files/<filename>.pdf` (or a `.gitkeep` if retrieval failed).
* If any retrieval fails, an intervention file under `intervention/` documenting the failure.
* `results/results_summary.md` summarising what was retrieved and any remaining gaps.

## Compute and Budget

* Local only. No compute cost. No paid API. If ILL charges apply, ask researcher before
  proceeding (typically free via Sheffield).

## Measurement

* Binary outcome per paper: retrieved (PDF + summary) or failed (metadata + abstract-only
  summary + intervention file).

## Key Questions

1. Can both PDFs be retrieved via any combination of open-access / institutional / author
   routes?
2. If the full PDFs are obtained, does Sivyer2013 actually support the dendritic-spike branch-
   independence mechanism as the t0027 synthesis assumes, or does the paper make a more
   nuanced claim that changes the t0029 discriminator interpretation?

## Dependencies

None — this task runs independently of all sweeps and of t0023.

## Scientific Context

Source suggestion **S-0027-06** (medium priority). Closes the literature-coverage gap left by
t0027. Completing this coverage strengthens the interpretation of t0029 and t0030 sweep
results, especially for the Sivyer2013 mechanism which currently rests on the synthesis's
second-hand summary of that paper.

## Execution Notes

* Follow standard /execute-task flow.
* Include `planning` step (lightweight: which source to try first for each paper, how to
  handle failure).
* Skip `research-papers`, `research-internet`, `research-code` — this task IS the download
  work.
* Skip `setup-machines` / `teardown` (local only).
* Skip `compare-literature` (no quantitative results).
* Run paper asset verificator on each downloaded paper before committing.
