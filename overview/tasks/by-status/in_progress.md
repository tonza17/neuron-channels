# Literature survey: dendritic computation beyond DSGCs

## Motivation

Research question RQ4 (active vs passive dendrites) needs evidence from computational
neuroscience beyond the retinal literature. Cortical and cerebellar dendrites have been
studied far more extensively than DSGC dendrites, and the mechanisms and modelling conventions
developed there (NMDA spikes, Ca/Na plateaus, branch-level nonlinearities) are the natural
reference for whether active dendrites plausibly shape DSGC tuning curves. Source suggestion:
S-0014-02 from t0014_brainstorm_results_3.

## Scope

Target ~25 category-relevant papers covering:

1. NMDA spikes — thresholds, amplitudes, distance-dependence, supralinear integration.
2. Na+ and Ca2+ dendritic spikes — backpropagation, forward propagation, local spikes.
3. Plateau potentials — in-vivo evidence, role in coincidence detection, duration scaling.
4. Branch-level nonlinearities — independent subunits, clustered-vs-distributed input
   summation.
5. Sublinear-to-supralinear integration regimes — what controls the transition, which
   conditions make dendrites behave passively in practice.
6. Active-vs-passive modelling comparisons — cortical, cerebellar, hippocampal studies that
   built matched active and passive compartmental models and quantified the difference.

Exclusion: do not re-add any DOI already present in the t0002 corpus. Duplicates discovered
mid task must be dropped and the exclusion recorded in the task log.

## Approach

1. Run `/research-internet` targeting each of the six themes above with preference for review
   articles plus 2-4 primary studies per theme.
2. For each shortlisted paper, invoke `/download-paper`. Paywalled papers are recorded as
   `download_status: "failed"` and added to `intervention/paywalled_papers.md` for the
   researcher to retrieve manually.
3. Write one answer asset synthesising which dendritic-computation mechanisms plausibly
   transfer to DSGC dendrites, with explicit caveats about anatomical and biophysical
   differences.

## Expected Outputs

* ~25 paper assets under `assets/paper/` (v3 spec compliant), some possibly with
  `download_status: "failed"`.
* One answer asset under `assets/answer/` synthesising the six themes and flagging mechanisms
  most plausible for DSGC dendrites.
* `intervention/paywalled_papers.md` listing DOIs requiring manual retrieval.

## Compute and Budget

No paid services required. Task-type budget gate cleared by the $1 bump set in t0014.

## Dependencies

None.

## Verification Criteria

* At least 20 paper assets pass `verify_paper_asset.py`.
* The answer asset passes `verify_answer_asset.py` and explicitly addresses transferability to
  DSGC dendrites.
* No paper in this task's `assets/paper/` shares a DOI with the t0002 corpus.

# Literature survey: patch-clamp recordings of RGCs and DSGCs

## Motivation

The DSGC model needs validation against real electrophysiology. Patch-clamp recordings of
retinal ganglion cells provide the quantitative targets that optimisation and tuning-curve
scoring tasks (t0004, t0012) must match: somatic action-potential rates, EPSP/IPSC kinetics,
null/preferred response ratios. This survey assembles the experimental-data landscape
separately from the modelling corpus in t0002. Source suggestion: S-0014-03 from
t0014_brainstorm_results_3.

## Scope

Target ~25 category-relevant papers covering:

1. Somatic whole-cell recordings of RGCs — firing-rate statistics, spike-threshold
   distributions.
2. Voltage-clamp conductance dissections — separating AMPA/NMDA/GABA currents during DS
   responses.
3. Space-clamp error analyses — how much of published conductance asymmetry is real vs an
   artefact of imperfect voltage clamp in extended dendrites.
4. Spike-train tuning-curve measurements — angle-resolved AP rates and their variability.
5. In-vitro stimulus protocols — moving bars, drifting gratings, and spots used to probe DS.

Exclusion: do not re-add any DOI already present in the t0002 corpus. Duplicates discovered
mid task must be dropped and the exclusion recorded in the task log.

## Approach

1. Run `/research-internet` targeting each theme, giving weight to papers that publish raw
   conductance traces or tabulated tuning-curve peak rates.
2. For each shortlisted paper, invoke `/download-paper`. Paywalled papers are recorded as
   `download_status: "failed"` and added to `intervention/paywalled_papers.md`.
3. Write one answer asset mapping each paper to the model-validation targets it provides (AP
   rate, IPSC asymmetry, EPSP kinetics, null/preferred ratios) with explicit numerical values.

## Expected Outputs

* ~25 paper assets under `assets/paper/` (v3 spec compliant).
* One answer asset under `assets/answer/` with a validation-target table keyed by paper DOI.
* `intervention/paywalled_papers.md` listing DOIs requiring manual retrieval.

## Compute and Budget

No paid services required. Task-type budget gate cleared by the $1 bump set in t0014.

## Dependencies

None.

## Verification Criteria

* At least 20 paper assets pass `verify_paper_asset.py`.
* The answer asset passes `verify_answer_asset.py` and contains a validation-target table with
  at least five numerical rows.
* No paper in this task's `assets/paper/` shares a DOI with the t0002 corpus.
