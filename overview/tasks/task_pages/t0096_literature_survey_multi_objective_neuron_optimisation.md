# Literature Survey: Multi-Objective Optimisation of Single-Neuron Compartmental Models

## Motivation

The morphology + channel optimisation pipeline is now production-ready: t0091
(`morphology_extended_nsga2_v1`) is currently running the first joint 68-d NSGA-II (54-d
electrophys \+ 14-d morphology) on the t0092-patched procedural generator validated at scale
by t0093. Every multi-objective optimisation task this project has run so far (t0076, t0078,
t0080, t0081, t0083, t0086, t0091) has used the same two objectives: direction selectivity
index (DSI) and firing rate. That objective pair was the right choice for the project's
first-question ("which channels maximise DS?") phase, but it leaves the broader
multi-objective landscape unexplored.

The researcher's strategic directive (brainstorm session 20, 2026-05-08) is to broaden the
optimisation objective space:

> Now that we have working optimisation for both morphology and channel composition we can optimise
> for different things. Currently we optimise for DSI and firing rate. However I would like to
> compare results for all sorts of stuff. For example, I would like to optimise for DSI and
> information transfer rate; DSI and energy spent, DSI and minimisation of citoplasm volume etc.
> Perform an extensive literature search and find papers that use different forms of optimisation.
> It does not need to be DSGC but can be any neurons.

This task is the literature-research foundation for that broadening. It catalogues every
objective function used in the published multi-objective single-neuron optimisation
literature, delivers formulas + computational recipes for each, and produces a ranked list of
future MOBO tasks to commission once budget permits. The deliverable is intentionally
actionable: each catalogued objective must be implementable on top of the existing Bed B
NSGA-II loop without infrastructure rewrites.

The task is also the right test of biological plausibility as an optimisation criterion. The
researcher's recurring concern across this project has been that pure DSI maximisation admits
non-physical solutions; jointly optimising DSI vs energy, vs cytoplasm volume, or vs
robustness forces the optimiser into bio-realistic regions of the parameter space. The survey
should explicitly document, per objective, whether published work treats it as a biological
constraint or only as a performance proxy.

## Scope

### In Scope

* **Multi-objective methodology papers** covering single-neuron compartmental models:
  Druckmann et al. 2007 ("A novel multiple objective optimization framework for constraining
  conductance-based neuron models by experimental data"), Druckmann et al. 2011 (eFEL
  precursor), Achard & De Schutter 2006 (first MOEA Purkinje fits), Van Geit et al.
  (NeuroFitter / BluePyOpt), Rumbell et al. (cortical L5 PC MOBO), Hay et al. 2011 (BBP
  cortical L5 multi-objective).
* **Information-theoretic objective functions**: mutual information between stimulus and spike
  train (Bialek, De Ruyter van Steveninck, Strong et al.), Fisher information / discrimination
  capacity (Brunel, Nadal), channel capacity, stimulus-reconstruction MSE, spike-train metrics
  (Victor & Purpura, van Rossum).
* **Metabolic / energy objective functions**: ATP per spike, total ionic flux, Na+/K+ pump
  cost (Attwell & Laughlin 2001 "An energy budget for signaling in the grey matter of the
  brain"), bits-per-ATP energy efficiency (Niven & Laughlin 2008, Sengupta et al. 2010 "Action
  potential energy efficiency varies among neuron types in vertebrates and invertebrates").
* **Structural / wiring objective functions**: total dendritic length, total membrane area,
  cytoplasm / dendritic volume, wiring economy (Chklovskii et al., Cuntz, Forstner, Borst &
  Hausser 2010 "One rule to grow them all").
* **Robustness / degeneracy objective functions**: parameter-perturbation sensitivity, noise
  tolerance (Marder & Goaillard 2006 "Variability, compensation and homeostasis in neuron and
  network function"; Prinz, Bucher & Marder 2004 "Similar network activity from disparate
  circuit parameters").
* **Temporal / coding objective functions**: latency, jitter, spike-timing precision,
  bandwidth, dynamic range.
* **Methods / codebases**: BluePyOpt (Van Geit), NeuroFitter, NSGA-II + NSGA-III in pymoo,
  MOEA literature (Deb et al.), Pareto-front analysis methods (hypervolume, IGD, R2
  indicator).

### Out of Scope

* Network-level optimisation (multi-neuron). Stay on single-neuron compartmental models.
* Reinforcement-learning / deep-learning policy optimisation. Stay on classical MOBO / MOEA.
* Phenomenological integrate-and-fire models without compartmental structure (mention briefly
  if they yield reusable objectives, but do not deep-dive).

## Must-Find Objective Categories

The survey must deliver formula + units + NEURON-side computational recipe for at least one
representative objective in each of these four categories:

1. **Information transfer rate / mutual information** — between stimulus angle and spike-train
   output for our DSGC case. Concrete recipe must specify how to estimate MI from a
   t0091-style 8-direction trial output (e.g., binned spike counts per direction, direct
   method, or extrapolation method).

2. **Metabolic energy / ATP per spike** — computable from HH ionic currents in NEURON.
   Concrete recipe must specify which currents to integrate (Na+ influx, K+ efflux, leak) and
   the conversion factor from charge to ATP molecules (3 Na+ exchanged per ATP via Na+/K+
   ATPase).

3. **Cytoplasm volume / wiring cost** — computable directly from morphology. Concrete recipe:
   sum over compartments of pi * r^2 * L; or total surface area as an alternative; or wiring
   cost = sum of section lengths weighted by diameter.

4. **Robustness / degeneracy** — parameter-perturbation sensitivity of DSI; multi-conductance
   solution-space volume. Concrete recipe must specify a Marder-style protocol: e.g., +/- 10
   percent random perturbation of all channel densities and report DSI standard deviation as
   the objective.

If the literature search uncovers more well-defined objective categories not in this list, add
them to the catalogue and rank them by biological plausibility and computational feasibility.

## Approach

### Stage 1: Research Papers

Survey methodology and biological objective-function origin papers. Download canonical
citations for each objective category. Read full text where available; abstract +
supplementary info otherwise. Produce `research/research_papers.md` with:

* Per-objective subsection grouping the 2-3 canonical papers
* Per-paper extracted formula, units, computational recipe
* Notes on biological plausibility and how the objective would interact with DSI in a
  multi-objective setting

### Stage 2: Research Internet

Survey codebases, tutorials, review articles, and online resources for multi-objective
single-neuron optimisation. Targets: BluePyOpt (Van Geit, github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt),
NeuroFitter, eFEL, pymoo NSGA-II + NSGA-III tutorials, Pareto-front diagnostic libraries
(pyDOE, paretoset). Document API surfaces and example usage that the project could adopt
without rewrites. Produce `research/research_internet.md`.

### Stage 3: Answer Asset

Synthesise findings into a single answer asset
`objective-functions-for-single-neuron-multi-objective-optimisation` (under `assets/answer/`).
Each catalogued objective gets a uniform record:

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Name | e.g. `mutual_information_stimulus_spike_train` |
| Mathematical formula | LaTeX |
| Units | e.g. bits per second, ATP per spike, um^3 |
| NEURON-side quantities required | Vm trace, ionic currents, spike times, morphology, etc. |
| Recipe | Step-by-step computation from a t0091-style 8-direction trial output |
| Biological plausibility | Notes on whether the objective is a hard biological constraint or a soft proxy |
| Direction-of-optimisation | Maximise / minimise / target value |
| Papers using it | At least 2 citations |

### Stage 4: Suggestions

Emit a ranked list of future MOBO tasks in `results/suggestions.json`. Each suggestion must
include:

* Title (e.g. "Bed B NSGA-II maximising DSI and ITR")
* Kind, priority
* Categories, source_paper if applicable
* Biological plausibility notes
* Budget feasibility estimate (Vast.ai EPYC + GPU hours)
* Cross-references to the catalogued objective entries

Suggestions must be ranked by combined biological-plausibility and budget-feasibility scores.
Aim for 3-6 ranked suggestions; do not pad.

## Cost Estimation

* **Total**: $0
* **Compute**: none. Local-only.
* **Paid services**: none.
* **Risk-of-going-over**: zero. The task is paper download + reading + writing.

## Step by Step

1. `init-folders`, `check-deps` (no deps to check).
2. Stage 1: research papers — download 10+ canonical papers; read; populate
   `research/research_papers.md`; create paper assets.
3. Stage 2: research internet — survey codebases, tutorials, review articles; populate
   `research/research_internet.md`.
4. Stage 3: answer asset — write the consolidated objective-function catalogue.
5. Stage 4: suggestions — write `results/suggestions.json` with the ranked future-MOBO list.
6. Reporting — write `results/results_summary.md` and `results/results_detailed.md`; run
   verificators; PR; merge.

## Remote Machines

None.

## Assets Needed

None. The task downloads its own paper assets.

## Expected Assets

* `paper`: at least 10 (covering methodology + four must-find categories)
* `answer`: 1 (the consolidated objective-function catalogue)

## Time Estimation

Approximately 2-4 hours wall-clock by an autonomous research agent. Roughly: 60-90 min paper
download + reading; 30-60 min internet survey + codebase review; 30-60 min answer asset
writing; 15-30 min suggestions + reporting + verification.

## Risks & Fallbacks

* **Paywalled paper not accessible** via Sci-Hub or institutional proxy: mark in
  `intervention/` and proceed with abstract + citation analysis. Do not block the task.
* **Cytoplasm volume has no direct precedent** in single-neuron optimisation literature: use
  the wiring-cost / total-length proxy and flag it as a novel objective contribution. The
  computational recipe is already trivial (sum over compartments of pi * r^2 * L) so the
  objective stays usable even without a published precedent.
* **Answer asset becomes too long** (>5000 words): split per category but keep one
  consolidated `short_answer.md` as the entry point. Each category subsection in
  `full_answer.md` may be a separate H2 section.
* **Literature search dilutes** because too many off-target papers come up: enforce the
  Out-of-Scope filter; prefer 2-3 canonical citations per category over comprehensive
  coverage.

## Verification Criteria

* All four must-find objective categories covered with formulas and computational recipes.
* At least 5 multi-objective compartmental-model methodology papers reviewed.
* At least 10 paper assets created and passing the paper asset verificator.
* Answer asset passes `meta/asset_types/answer/specification.md`.
* At least 3 ranked, budget-realistic future MOBO suggestions emitted in
  `results/suggestions.json`.
* All standard task verificators pass: `verify_task_file`, `verify_logs`,
  `verify_research_papers`, `verify_research_internet`, `verify_assets`, `verify_suggestions`,
  `verify_task_results`, `verify_pr_premerge`.

## Cross-References

* **t0091_morphology_extended_nsga2_v1** — current MOBO frontier (DSI + firing rate);
  catalogue's recipes must compose with t0091's trial-output format.
* **t0095_brainstorm_results_20** — commissioned this task.
* **t0002_literature_survey_dsgc_compartmental_models** — prior literature survey for
  stylistic consistency.
* **t0015 / t0016 / t0017 / t0018 / t0019 / t0027** — prior literature surveys for stylistic
  consistency and for any cross-cited references.
