# Generate canonical target angle-to-AP-rate tuning curve

## Motivation

The key project metric `tuning_curve_rmse` compares a simulated angle-to-AP-rate tuning curve
against a target. The researcher chose to **simulate** a canonical target curve rather than
digitise one from a paper. This task generates that canonical target and registers it as a
dataset asset so all later optimisation tasks share one fixed reference.

## Scope

Produce a single dataset asset containing:

* A cosine-like target tuning curve sampled at 12 or 24 angles around 360°.
* Explicit generator parameters: preferred direction (deg), baseline rate (Hz), peak rate
  (Hz), tuning half-width (deg or von Mises κ), and random seed.
* Per-angle mean rates plus a small number of synthetic noisy trial replicates so the
  `tuning_curve_reliability` metric has a well-defined ground-truth value.

Suggested functional form:

```
r(θ) = r_base + (r_peak - r_base) * ((1 + cos(θ - θ_pref)) / 2) ** n
```

with `n` controlling sharpness. Any equivalent von Mises formulation is fine. The exact values
of `r_base`, `r_peak`, `θ_pref`, and `n` should be chosen to give a biologically plausible DSI
(roughly 0.6-0.9) and reported in the dataset's `details.json`.

## Approach

1. Write a small Python script under `code/` that generates the curve, saves it to `data/` as
   CSV or JSON, and writes the dataset asset folder under `assets/dataset/`.
2. Include both a mean-rate table and a per-trial table (e.g., 20 synthetic trials) so
   `tuning_curve_reliability` has a real reference value.
3. Plot the curve and save to `results/images/target_tuning_curve.png`.

## Expected Outputs

* One dataset asset under `assets/dataset/target_tuning_curve/` containing the CSV/JSON
  tables, metadata, and description.
* A plot of the target curve in `results/images/`.

## Compute and Budget

Trivial. Runs locally in seconds; no external cost.

## Dependencies

None. Runs in parallel with t0002 and t0003. This task is the reference any later optimisation
task will compare against.

## Verification Criteria

* Dataset asset passes `verify_dataset_asset.py`.
* `details.json` records the generator parameters and random seed explicitly.
* The generated CSV/JSON has one row per angle and the noisy-trial table has at least 10
  trials per angle.
