# Literature survey: synaptic integration in RGC-adjacent systems

## Motivation

Research question RQ3 (AMPA/GABA balance) and later synaptic-parameter optimisation need prior
distributions for receptor kinetics, E-I ratios, and spatial-distribution patterns. The
modelling literature in t0002 touches these parameters but does not systematically cover the
synaptic- integration experimental and theoretical work that underpins them. Source
suggestion: S-0014-04 from t0014_brainstorm_results_3.

## Scope

Target ~25 category-relevant papers covering:

1. AMPA/NMDA/GABA receptor kinetics — rise and decay time constants, reversal potentials.
2. Shunting inhibition — location-dependent vetoing, input resistance changes.
3. E-I balance — temporal co-tuning, conductance ratios in retinal and cortical systems.
4. Temporal summation — how closely spaced inputs integrate vs saturate.
5. Dendritic-location dependence — soma-vs-dendrite integration, attenuation before the spike
   initiation zone.
6. Synaptic-density scaling — synapses per micrometre of dendrite, bouton counts.
7. SAC/DSGC inhibitory asymmetry — starburst amacrine cell GABA output onto DSGC dendrites in
   the preferred vs null directions.

Exclusion: do not re-add any DOI already present in the t0002 corpus. Duplicates discovered
mid task must be dropped and the exclusion recorded in the task log.

## Approach

1. Run `/research-internet` targeting each theme, preferring studies that publish fitted
   kinetic parameters or conductance-ratio measurements rather than qualitative reports.
2. For each shortlisted paper, invoke `/download-paper`. Paywalled papers are recorded as
   `download_status: "failed"` and added to `intervention/paywalled_papers.md`.
3. Write one answer asset tabulating receptor kinetics and E-I ratios usable as prior
   distributions for later optimisation tasks.

## Expected Outputs

* ~25 paper assets under `assets/paper/` (v3 spec compliant).
* One answer asset under `assets/answer/` with a prior-distribution table for kinetics and E-I
  ratios, keyed by paper DOI and region.
* `intervention/paywalled_papers.md` listing DOIs requiring manual retrieval.

## Compute and Budget

No paid services required. Task-type budget gate cleared by the $1 bump set in t0014.

## Dependencies

None.

## Verification Criteria

* At least 20 paper assets pass `verify_paper_asset.py`.
* The answer asset passes `verify_answer_asset.py` and provides a numeric prior-distribution
  table.
* No paper in this task's `assets/paper/` shares a DOI with the t0002 corpus.
