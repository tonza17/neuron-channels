<summary>🧪 <strong>GABA conductance scan under SEClamp toward paper PD 12.5 / ND

SEClamp at -65 mV yielded GABA PD = 47.47 / ND = 48.04 nS vs paper's 12.5 / 30 nS. Run a
`gabaMOD` (or per-synapse GABA) scan under SEClamp at gNMDA = 0.5 nS, exptype = control, with
multiplier values across {1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125} of the deposited base, and additionally test
introducing PD/ND spatial asymmetry (e.g., scale ND-side GABA up by 2-3x and PD-side GABA
down) to see whether the paper's ND-bias DSI -0.41 is recoverable by a spatial redistribution
at the soma. Distinct from S-0048-01 which scans GABA at exptype = 2 across a gNMDA sweep
without SEClamp; this task uses SEClamp modality at single gNMDA. Recommended task types:
experiment-run.

<summary>🧪 <strong>Implement AIS compartment, NMDARs, and simulated voltage-clamp

The answer asset patch-clamp-techniques-and-constraints-for-dsgc-modelling produces a 7-point
specification for DSGC modelling in NEURON extending the cable-theory and
dendritic-computation specifications from t0015 and t0016. The downstream DSGC
compartmental-model build task must implement: (1) an explicit AIS compartment with Nav1.6 at
7x the somatic Na+ density, with AIS length as a tunable parameter; (2) NMDARs with standard
Mg2+ block kinetics on DSGC dendrites alongside AMPARs; (3) a simulated somatic voltage-clamp
block (SEClamp) so experimental and simulated voltage-clamp readouts can be compared on the
same footing; (4) depolarisation-block threshold and AMPA/NMDA charge ratio during preferred
and null motion as named fitting objectives. Validation must include DSI reduction under
simulated NMDAR block to match Sethuramanujam2017 and maintained activity under simulated
synaptic blockade to resolve the MargolisDetwiler2007 intrinsic-vs-synaptic question for the
target DSGC subtype.

<summary>🧪 <strong>Nav1.1 proximal-AIS knockout channel-swap on the t0022

Use the t0022 modeldb_189347_dsgc_dendritic library's AIS_PROXIMAL forsec block to append a
proximal axon segment populated with Nav1.1 at ~7x somatic density, then knock it out (set
gbar to 0) and rerun the canonical 12-angle x 10-trial sweep. VanWart2006 reports Nav1.1
dominates the proximal AIS while Nav1.6 dominates the distal AIS; removing proximal Nav1.1
should drop excitability and test whether DSI survives reduced spike-initiation margin.
Expected outcome: peak rate drops below 10 Hz while DSI holds above 0.5 (inhibitory shunt
intact, spike threshold only moved). Dependencies: t0022 library asset. Effort ~6 hours.
Recommended task type: experiment-run.

Sweep Nav1.6 density in the AIS_DISTAL forsec block over {4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16} S/cm^2
(centred on the Kole-Stuart 2008 ~8 S/cm^2 published anchor) with Kv1.2 held constant, rerun
the 12-angle x 10-trial sweep at each setting, and report peak firing rate vs Nav1.6 density.
Peak-rate cap at 10-20 Hz is shared across t0008 (18.1 Hz), t0020 (14.85 Hz), and t0022 (15
Hz) and is inherited from the unchanged t0008 HHst Na/K density, so the fix lives in the
distal AIS. Expected outcome: peak rate scales monotonically with Nav1.6 density and lands
inside 30-40 Hz at ~8 S/cm^2, matching Poleg-Polsky & Diamond 2016 and Oesch2005.
Dependencies: t0022 library asset. Effort ~12 hours. Recommended task type: experiment-run,

compare_literature.md flags that the paper reports concrete subthreshold validation targets
that this task did not measure: PD NMDAR-mediated PSP component 5.8 +/- 3.1 mV and ND 3.3 +/-
2.8 mV (Fig 1D, n=19), and NMDAR multiplicative scaling slope angle 62.5 +/- 14.2 deg (Fig 1H,
additive baseline 45 deg). Extend the gabaMOD-swap driver to record somatic whole-cell voltage
traces (v_soma, not just spike count) across the 40-trial sweep, compute (1) the peak PSP
amplitude in a 0-200 ms post-stimulus window per condition and (2) the slope-angle regression
over a scan of AMPA vs NMDA drive ratios, then gate each against the paper's n=19 mean +/- SD
intervals. This turns a single spike-output check into a multi-level subthreshold validation
that exercises the cell's passive and NMDA-block biophysics independently of spike
thresholding. Recommended task types: experiment-run, comparative-analysis.

The scaled-down 5-paper survey covers the four DSGC-modelling sub-areas identified in the plan
(space-clamp, AIS, NMDARs, maintained activity) but leaves several high-priority follow-on
topics uncovered: (a) DSGC-specific dynamic-clamp studies that use injected conductance
waveforms to test direction selectivity mechanisms, (b) DSGC Ih/HCN biophysics and resonance
properties, (c) DSGC-specific AIS measurements (the Werginz2020 paper is on OFF-alpha T cells,
not on ON-OFF DSGCs directly), and (d) large-scale compartmental-model fitting pipelines for
RGCs. A follow-up survey task should add ~5 papers across these four sub-areas to close the
gap.

Kole & Letzkus 2007 report that Kv1 in the proximal AIS sets spike threshold while Kv3 in the
distal AIS sets repolarisation speed and thus maximum sustained firing rate. Use the t0022
AIS_PROXIMAL and AIS_DISTAL forsec blocks to implement four conditions: (a) Kv1 proximal + Kv3
distal (canonical), (b) Kv1 distal + Kv3 proximal (swap), (c) Kv1 both (no Kv3), (d) Kv3 both
(no Kv1), each with Nav1.6 held at 8 S/cm^2 in the distal AIS. Rerun the 12-angle x 10-trial
sweep for each condition. Expected outcome: condition (a) peaks near 30-40 Hz; condition (b)
drops peak because distal Kv1 fails to fast-repolarise; conditions (c) and (d) test whether
either K-channel alone suffices. Dependencies: t0022 library asset. Effort ~16 hours.

t0049 ran the SEClamp re-measurement at exptype=control (Voff_bipNMDA=0). t0048 established
that exptype=2 (Voff_bipNMDA=1, voltage-independent NMDA) is the paper-faithful canonical
control. Repeat the same 32-trial SEClamp sweep (2 directions x 4 channel-isolations x 4
trials at gNMDA = 0.5 nS, V_clamp = -65 mV) under exptype=2 to establish whether the residual
NMDA over-amplification (SEClamp PD 13.89 vs paper 7.0) and direction-asymmetry collapse
persist under voltage-independent NMDA. This locks the canonical SEClamp baseline alongside
the canonical exptype convention before downstream parameter-tuning work begins. Recommended
task types: experiment-run.

Park2014 (paper 10.1523_JNEUROSCI.5017-13.2014) and Chen2009 (paper
10.1113_jphysiol.2008.161240) are the two papers that set the mouse ON-OFF DSGC RQ5 targets
(DSI 0.6-0.9, peak 40-80 Hz, HWHM 60-90 deg). Park2014 is available open-access. Digitise the
published tuning-curve figure(s) into a reusable dataset asset (angle in degrees, spike rate
in Hz, error bars, cell counts) so the model can be scored against measured data rather than
only against the analytic target in t0004. This gives the project a literature-grounded

t0049 ran SEClamp at the single V_clamp = -65 mV which yields a small GABA driving force (-5
mV vs E_GABA = -60 mV) and amplifies noise on the GABA conductance estimate (SD +/- 1.98 nS at
PD). Repeat the per-channel isolation sweep at V_clamp in {-85, -65, -45} mV. The -85 mV
condition gives a 25 mV GABA driving force (5x improvement in GABA SNR) and inverts the
AMPA/NMDA driving force; the -45 mV condition reverses the GABA driving force sign and
increases NMDA Mg-block relief. Tests (a) whether the GABA PD/ND symmetry persists across
V_clamp (ruling out driving-force noise), (b) whether NMDA over-amplification depends on
holding voltage. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

t0049 measured SEClamp conductance only at the soma (`h.RGC.soma(0.5)`). The GABA PD/ND
symmetry collapse at the soma could be due to (a) cable-filtering averaging out local
asymmetry, or (b) symmetric spatial distribution of GABA synapses across PD/ND-side dendrites.
To discriminate, insert SEClamp at intermediate dendritic locations along the principal axis
(e.g., at 25%, 50%, 75% of the dendritic path from soma to the most distal synapse on each
side) and re-run the per-channel isolation sweep at gNMDA = 0.5 nS. A monotonic decay of the
asymmetry from distal-dendrite to soma supports the cable-filtering hypothesis (b ruled out);
persistence at all locations supports the spatial-distribution hypothesis (a ruled out).
Complementary to S-0049-01's static spatial audit. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

t0047 records `_ref_g` directly at each synapse and obtains summed peak conductances 6-9x the
paper's Fig 3A-E targets and per-synapse-mean values 28-90x under. Neither interpretation
reconciles. The paper's Fig 3A-E most likely reports a somatic voltage-clamp-recorded compound
conductance — a third quantity not measured here. Implement a NEURON SEClamp at the soma held
at -65 mV across the same 7-point gNMDA sweep, record `_ref_i` on the clamp, and deconvolve
per-channel conductance via `g(t) = i(t) / (V_clamp - e_rev)` with `e_NMDA = e_AMPA = 0` and
`e_SACinhib = -60 mV`. Compare against paper targets within +/- 25%. Distinct from S-0046-02
