<summary>🧪 <strong>Implement AIS compartment, NMDARs, and simulated voltage-clamp

The answer asset patch-clamp-techniques-and-constraints-for-dsgc-modelling produces a 7-point
specification for DSGC modelling in NEURON extending the cable-theory and
dendritic-computation specifications from t0015 and t0016. The downstream DSGC
compartmental-model build task must implement: (1) an explicit AIS compartment with Nav1.6 at
7x the somatic Na+ density, with AIS length as a tunable parameter; (2) NMDARs with standard
Mg2+ block kinetics on DSGC dendrites alongside AMPARs; (3) a simulated somatic voltage-clamp
block (SEClamp) so experimental and simulated voltage-clamp readouts can be compared on the
same footing; (4) depolarisation-block threshold and AMPA/NMDA charge ratio during preferred
and null motion as named fitting objectives. Validation must include DSI reduction under
simulated NMDAR block to match Sethuramanujam2017 and maintained activity under simulated
synaptic blockade to resolve the MargolisDetwiler2007 intrinsic-vs-synaptic question for the
target DSGC subtype.

Real RGC AIS diameters cluster around 0.4-0.8 μm; t0069 used 1 μm. A narrower AIS has higher
input resistance per unit area, so the same gbar of an AIS-localised Nav or Kv channel
produces a much larger local depolarisation. Test: rebuild the AIS at diam=0.5 μm (keep L=30
μm), keep all other parameters identical to t0069, re-run the 16-condition × 2-direction ×
5-seed sweep. Combined with S-0069-01 (halved somatic Na), this should be the configuration
that finally exposes AIS-localised Kv3 / Kv4 effects. Compute: ~10 min.

The scaled-down 5-paper survey covers the four DSGC-modelling sub-areas identified in the plan
(space-clamp, AIS, NMDARs, maintained activity) but leaves several high-priority follow-on
topics uncovered: (a) DSGC-specific dynamic-clamp studies that use injected conductance
waveforms to test direction selectivity mechanisms, (b) DSGC Ih/HCN biophysics and resonance
properties, (c) DSGC-specific AIS measurements (the Werginz2020 paper is on OFF-alpha T cells,
not on ON-OFF DSGCs directly), and (d) large-scale compartmental-model fitting pipelines for
RGCs. A follow-up survey task should add ~5 papers across these four sub-areas to close the
gap.

SEClamp at -65 mV yielded GABA PD = 47.47 / ND = 48.04 nS vs paper's 12.5 / 30 nS. Run a
`gabaMOD` (or per-synapse GABA) scan under SEClamp at gNMDA = 0.5 nS, exptype = control, with
multiplier values across {1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125} of the deposited base, and additionally test
introducing PD/ND spatial asymmetry (e.g., scale ND-side GABA up by 2-3x and PD-side GABA
down) to see whether the paper's ND-bias DSI -0.41 is recoverable by a spatial redistribution
at the soma. Distinct from S-0048-01 which scans GABA at exptype = 2 across a gNMDA sweep
without SEClamp; this task uses SEClamp modality at single gNMDA. Recommended task types:

Kole & Letzkus 2007 report that Kv1 in the proximal AIS sets spike threshold while Kv3 in the
distal AIS sets repolarisation speed and thus maximum sustained firing rate. Use the t0022
AIS_PROXIMAL and AIS_DISTAL forsec blocks to implement four conditions: (a) Kv1 proximal + Kv3
distal (canonical), (b) Kv1 distal + Kv3 proximal (swap), (c) Kv1 both (no Kv3), (d) Kv3 both
(no Kv1), each with Nav1.6 held at 8 S/cm^2 in the distal AIS. Rerun the 12-angle x 10-trial
sweep for each condition. Expected outcome: condition (a) peaks near 30-40 Hz; condition (b)
drops peak because distal Kv1 fails to fast-repolarise; conditions (c) and (d) test whether
either K-channel alone suffices. Dependencies: t0022 library asset. Effort ~16 hours.
Recommended task type: experiment-run, comparative-analysis.

Real RGCs concentrate Nav1.6 and Kv3 at the AIS at ~50x somatic densities. The Nav1.6 + Kv3
co-localisation we modelled here is somatic, which the t0067 / t0068 limitations document as
understating the joint effect. Add a 30-um AIS section to the deposited cell, place Nav1.6 +
Kv3 there at 30 / 90 mS/cm^2 (and a wider Kv3 density grid up to ~200 mS/cm^2), re-run the
rescue sweep. Expected: AIS-localised Kv3 at very high density may finally show DSI rescue
because the AIS's smaller diameter makes per-segment conductance changes leverage the AP shape
more strongly. If still no rescue, the channel-pharmacology approach to DSI rescue is null
across substrates.

Use the t0022 modeldb_189347_dsgc_dendritic library's AIS_PROXIMAL forsec block to append a
proximal axon segment populated with Nav1.1 at ~7x somatic density, then knock it out (set
gbar to 0) and rerun the canonical 12-angle x 10-trial sweep. VanWart2006 reports Nav1.1
dominates the proximal AIS while Nav1.6 dominates the distal AIS; removing proximal Nav1.1
should drop excitability and test whether DSI survives reduced spike-initiation margin.
Expected outcome: peak rate drops below 10 Hz while DSI holds above 0.5 (inhibitory shunt
intact, spike threshold only moved). Dependencies: t0022 library asset. Effort ~6 hours.
Recommended task type: experiment-run.

Sweep Nav1.6 density in the AIS_DISTAL forsec block over {4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16} S/cm^2
(centred on the Kole-Stuart 2008 ~8 S/cm^2 published anchor) with Kv1.2 held constant, rerun
the 12-angle x 10-trial sweep at each setting, and report peak firing rate vs Nav1.6 density.
Peak-rate cap at 10-20 Hz is shared across t0008 (18.1 Hz), t0020 (14.85 Hz), and t0022 (15
Hz) and is inherited from the unchanged t0008 HHst Na/K density, so the fix lives in the
distal AIS. Expected outcome: peak rate scales monotonically with Nav1.6 density and lands
inside 30-40 Hz at ~8 S/cm^2, matching Poleg-Polsky & Diamond 2016 and Oesch2005.
Dependencies: t0022 library asset. Effort ~12 hours. Recommended task type: experiment-run,

t0049 ran the SEClamp re-measurement at exptype=control (Voff_bipNMDA=0). t0048 established
that exptype=2 (Voff_bipNMDA=1, voltage-independent NMDA) is the paper-faithful canonical
control. Repeat the same 32-trial SEClamp sweep (2 directions x 4 channel-isolations x 4
trials at gNMDA = 0.5 nS, V_clamp = -65 mV) under exptype=2 to establish whether the residual
NMDA over-amplification (SEClamp PD 13.89 vs paper 7.0) and direction-asymmetry collapse
persist under voltage-independent NMDA. This locks the canonical SEClamp baseline alongside
the canonical exptype convention before downstream parameter-tuning work begins. Recommended
task types: experiment-run.

compare_literature.md flags that the paper reports concrete subthreshold validation targets
that this task did not measure: PD NMDAR-mediated PSP component 5.8 +/- 3.1 mV and ND 3.3 +/-
2.8 mV (Fig 1D, n=19), and NMDAR multiplicative scaling slope angle 62.5 +/- 14.2 deg (Fig 1H,
additive baseline 45 deg). Extend the gabaMOD-swap driver to record somatic whole-cell voltage
traces (v_soma, not just spike count) across the 40-trial sweep, compute (1) the peak PSP
amplitude in a 0-200 ms post-stimulus window per condition and (2) the slope-angle regression
over a scan of AMPA vs NMDA drive ratios, then gate each against the paper's n=19 mean +/- SD
intervals. This turns a single spike-output check into a multi-level subthreshold validation
that exercises the cell's passive and NMDA-block biophysics independently of spike
thresholding. Recommended task types: experiment-run, comparative-analysis.

published tuning-curve figure(s) into a reusable dataset asset (angle in degrees, spike rate

t0065 IPSP_PASSIVE traces are flat at e_SACinhib = -60 mV because the cell sits at the
inhibitory reversal under no excitation. The voltage trace cannot reveal the inhibitory
conductance time-course; only a voltage clamp can resolve g_inh(t). t0049 already has SEClamp
infrastructure for this cell. Combining the t0065 channel-isolation pattern (zero excitatory
drives via b2gampa = b2gnmda = s2gach = achMOD = 0) with a SEClamp at -65 mV (or any
non-equilibrium voltage offset from e_SACinhib) would resolve the inhibitory conductance in nS
as a function of time, separately for PD (gabaMOD = 0.33) and ND (gabaMOD = 0.99). This is
essential for quantifying the differential shunting magnitude that drives FULL-mode DSI: the
integral of g_inh(t) should be ~3x larger in ND than in PD. Expected output: two conductance
time-courses showing g_inhibitory(t) over the 1000 ms trial in PD vs ND, with peak g_inh and
integrated charge per direction.

t0049 ran SEClamp at the single V_clamp = -65 mV which yields a small GABA driving force (-5
mV vs E_GABA = -60 mV) and amplifies noise on the GABA conductance estimate (SD +/- 1.98 nS at
PD). Repeat the per-channel isolation sweep at V_clamp in {-85, -65, -45} mV. The -85 mV
condition gives a 25 mV GABA driving force (5x improvement in GABA SNR) and inverts the
AMPA/NMDA driving force; the -45 mV condition reverses the GABA driving force sign and
increases NMDA Mg-block relief. Tests (a) whether the GABA PD/ND symmetry persists across
V_clamp (ruling out driving-force noise), (b) whether NMDA over-amplification depends on
holding voltage. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

Voltage trace cannot resolve g_inh(t) when e_GABA = v_rest (zero current at rest regardless of
g). For the de Rosenroll cell specifically, combine the t0066 channel-isolation pattern (set
ach NetCon weights = 0; HHst zeroed) with a SEClamp at -65 mV (or any non-equilibrium offset
from e_GABA = -60). This will read inhibitory current in pA across the trial separately for PD
(gaba_release_prob = 0.05) and ND (gaba_release_prob = 0.80). Expected: the time-integrated
charge in ND should be ~3-16x larger than in PD depending on how synapse-level release prob
translates to mean conductance. Reuses t0049's SEClamp infrastructure (which was developed for
the deposited cell — would need a small port for the de Rosenroll synapse model). Parallel to
S-0065-03 for the deposited cell; together they give cross-model conductance benchmarks.

t0049 measured SEClamp conductance only at the soma (`h.RGC.soma(0.5)`). The GABA PD/ND
symmetry collapse at the soma could be due to (a) cable-filtering averaging out local
asymmetry, or (b) symmetric spatial distribution of GABA synapses across PD/ND-side dendrites.
To discriminate, insert SEClamp at intermediate dendritic locations along the principal axis
(e.g., at 25%, 50%, 75% of the dendritic path from soma to the most distal synapse on each
side) and re-run the per-channel isolation sweep at gNMDA = 0.5 nS. A monotonic decay of the
asymmetry from distal-dendrite to soma supports the cable-filtering hypothesis (b ruled out);
persistence at all locations supports the spatial-distribution hypothesis (a ruled out).
Complementary to S-0049-01's static spatial audit. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

The vendored BK MOD comes from Mainen-Sejnowski 1996 (cortical pyramidal); SK from Hay 2011
(L5 pyramidal). Their kinetics may not match RGC patch-clamp recordings. Run voltage-clamp
simulations on a single soma in NEURON for each MOD (step protocol from -90 to +40 mV in 10 mV
steps, 100 ms duration) and compare resulting current traces against Pfeiffer-Friedrich 2012
(mouse RGC BK) and Wang 2014 (mouse RGC SK). If the activation V_half or time constants
deviate by > 20%, retune the MOD parameters or vendor an RGC-specific MOD instead. Cost: ~1
hour coding + 10 min sim + 30 min comparison plotting. Outcome: either a validation note in
the library description, or a v0.2.0 of the channel pack with retuned RGC-specific kinetics.

The deposited Poleg-Polsky cell has no axon initial segment (AIS). Real RGCs concentrate
Nav1.6 / Kv1 at the AIS at ~50× somatic densities (per t0019 priors: 2500-5000 pS/μm² for
Nav1.6 at distal AIS). Putting these channels on the soma in t0067 is a simplification that
almost certainly understates their effect on AP initiation timing and shape. Add a 30 μm AIS
section between soma and a virtual axon (1 mm passive cable) to the build_dsgc, then re-run
the t0067 channel sweep with insertion on the AIS instead of the soma. Expected: same channels
show much larger DSI effects (because the AIS, being smaller and electrically isolated, is
more sensitive to gnabar additions). Cost: ~1 hour code + ~10 min compute.

t0069 falsified S-0067-03 because the AIS+axon couldn't dominate spike initiation against the
deposited cell's 400 mS/cm² somatic gnabar_HHst. The natural fix: reduce somatic gnabar to 200
mS/cm² (or 100), re-attach the same AIS+axon, and re-run the t0069 sweep. Hypothesis: with a
weakened soma, the AIS becomes the dominant spike-initiation zone and AIS-localised Nav1.6 /
NaP / NaR / Kv3 / Kv4 show ≥2× larger |ΔDSI| than at the unweakened-soma baseline.
Implementation is a 1-line patch to apply_params (or a new HOC override) plus the existing
t0069 sweep code; ~10 min compute. This is the prerequisite for any meaningful AIS channel
test on this cell.

compartmental models. Target ~25 category-relevant papers covering somatic whole-cell
recordings of RGCs, voltage-clamp conductance dissections, space-clamp error analyses,
spike-train tuning-curve measurements, and in-vitro stimulus protocols. Exclude the 20 DOIs
already in the t0002 corpus. Output: paper assets + synthesis mapping each paper to the model
validation targets (AP rate, IPSC asymmetry, EPSP kinetics, null/preferred ratios).

t0047 records `_ref_g` directly at each synapse and obtains summed peak conductances 6-9x the
paper's Fig 3A-E targets and per-synapse-mean values 28-90x under. Neither interpretation
reconciles. The paper's Fig 3A-E most likely reports a somatic voltage-clamp-recorded compound
conductance — a third quantity not measured here. Implement a NEURON SEClamp at the soma held
at -65 mV across the same 7-point gNMDA sweep, record `_ref_i` on the clamp, and deconvolve
per-channel conductance via `g(t) = i(t) / (V_clamp - e_rev)` with `e_NMDA = e_AMPA = 0` and
`e_SACinhib = -60 mV`. Compare against paper targets within +/- 25%. Distinct from S-0046-02
(synapse-count) and S-0046-05 (supplementary PDF); also distinct from S-0019-XX which targets
a downstream model build, not the deposited code. Recommended task types: experiment-run.
