t0034 produced a non-monotonic primary DSI (0.545-0.774, p=0.038) and a clean monotonic
vector-sum DSI decline (R^2=0.91) that falsified Dan2018's passive-TR prediction and did not
fit Sivyer2013's plateau. Creative-thinking flagged passive cable filtering past an optimal
electrotonic length (Tukker2004, Hausselt2007) as the best fit, with local-spike-failure
(Schachter2010) explaining the preferred-angle jumps at 1.5x and 2.0x. A marginal length sweep
alone cannot distinguish these two mechanisms because lambda = sqrt(d*Rm/(4*Ra)) couples
length and diameter nonlinearly. Run a 3x3 grid (length in {0.5, 1.0, 2.0} x diameter in {0.5,
1.0, 2.0}) on the t0024 port with AR(2) rho=0.6, 12-direction x 10-trial protocol per cell,
and classify each cell as cable-limited, spike-amplified, or threshold-transition. Distinct
from S-0030-04 (same approach on t0022 testbed, which was pinned at DSI=1.000 and cannot
resolve the effect). Recommended task types: experiment-run.

The calibrated proximal Rin (0.52 MOhm) and distal Rin (54 MOhm) are far below Schachter
2010's 150-200 MOhm proximal and >1 GOhm distal targets because the pure-literature
Poleg-Polsky three-bin radii are not tuned to our cell. Keep the three-bin (primary / mid /
terminal) structure but treat the three radii as free parameters; fit them in a NEURON
passive-properties simulation (Ra=100 Ohm-cm, Rm fit jointly) so that soma Rin lands in
150-200 MOhm and distal-tip Rin >= 1 GOhm. Seed the optimiser with the Poleg-Polsky means
(3.694/1.653/0.439 um) and emit a corrections file that overrides
dsgc-baseline-morphology-calibrated with the fitted radii. Blocks downstream DSI reproductions
against Schachter's tree. Recommended task types: feature-engineering, experiment-run.

t0039 on t0022 at GABA=4 nS produced a passive_filtering signature (slope=-0.034, p=0.008).
Rerun the same 7-diameter sweep on t0024 (de_rosenroll_2026_dsgc, richer channel inventory,
AR(2) stochastic release) at its equivalent operational GABA level to test whether the
Schachter2010 concave-down signature emerges when active dendritic machinery is available. If
t0024 shows concave-down and t0022 shows monotonic decrease, that is the cleanest
testbed-level discrimination between the two mechanisms the project has produced. If both show
passive_filtering, that rules out Schachter2010 across the substrates the project has
available.

Re-plot DSI from all existing t0034 (length sweep) and t0035 (diameter sweep) trials against
the computed distal electrotonic length L/lambda, using morphology and passive parameters
already stored in each task's outputs. If the length and diameter data collapse onto a single
curve, this confirms creative_thinking.md's primary hypothesis: the length/diameter asymmetry
is a consequence of cable theory (L/lambda is linear in length but scales as 1/sqrt(d)). No
new simulations required; ~1-2 hours of re-analysis work only. Recommended task types:

The scoped-down 5-paper survey covers 3 of the 5 originally-planned themes in depth (Rall
foundations, on-the-path shunting DS, morphology-driven firing) and references the other two
(frequency-domain cable analysis, thin-dendrite transmission) only indirectly. A follow-up
survey task should add ~5 papers on frequency-domain cable theory (Koch 1984, Segev & Rall
1988) and thin-dendrite active transmission (Stuart & Sakmann 1994, London & Hausser 2005
review, Stuart & Spruston 2015 review) to close the gap.

Dan2018 reports monotonic DSI-vs-length over 50-400 um distal branches; Sivyer2013's critical
length sits at ~150 um. The t0022 distal-leaf baseline is on the order of tens of um, so the
0.5-2.0x sweep likely spans only ~15-160 um, overlapping only the tail of Sivyer2013's range
and sitting entirely below Dan2018's critical length. Add three extreme sweep points at 3.0x,
5.0x, and 8.0x while keeping the rest of the t0022 testbed fixed. Watch for `d_lambda`
violations at extreme lengths (fallback: adaptive `nseg` at each point). Possible outcomes:
(a) DSI stays at 1.000 and peak Hz continues linear decline - testbed is cable-dominated at
the soma and no resolution is possible; (b) DSI drops at a specific high multiplier with
monotonic HWHM broadening - Dan2018 passive-TR regime emerges; (c) DSI drops with HWHM
narrowing at a specific multiplier - Sivyer2013 dendritic-spike-failure regime emerges. ~45
min CPU. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

Push the diameter multiplier beyond t0035's narrow 0.5x-2.0x range into a wider 0.25x-4.0x
sweep (nine multipliers) on the t0024 DSGC substrate to look for non-linear DSI effects that
the 4x range missed. Specifically targets two possibilities: (a) input-impedance saturation at
baseline may break at extreme thinning/thickening and (b) the cable-theory 1/sqrt(d)
prediction implies a detectable DSI shift over a 16x diameter range even if a 4x range is
inside the noise floor. Distinct from S-0030-03 which targets t0022. Recommended task types:

t0034 covered 0.5x-2.0x (7 points) and found the primary-DSI peak at 0.75x (0.774) with a
non-monotonic decline beyond. To fit Tukker2004's intermediate-electrotonic-length optimum
quantitatively and to test whether the curve continues falling or saturates beyond 2.0x,
extend the sweep to 0.25x, 0.375x, 0.5x, 0.75x, 1.0x, 1.5x, 2.0x, 3.0x, 4.0x (9 points). Keep
the standard 12-direction x 10-trial protocol and AR(2) rho=0.6. Expected outcomes: (a) a
clear DSI peak at intermediate length with symmetric falloff on both sides (supports
Tukker2004 optimum); (b) preferred-angle instability across 3.0x-4.0x (supports Schachter2010
local-spike-failure); (c) d_lambda violations at extreme lengths (engineering concern - apply
adaptive nseg at each point). Distinct from S-0029-03 (same approach on t0022 testbed which

t0039 found DSI saturates at 0.429 for D in {0.5, 0.75, 1.0}, matching the t0037 4 nS ceiling.
This is the discriminator's upper bound at this GABA level. A finer sweep thinner than 0.5x
would locate the saturation edge and bound the headroom available to any morphology optimiser

Sweep distal Ih (HCN) gbar from 0 to 2x baseline (five points) on the t0024 DSGC while holding
all other parameters fixed, and measure primary DSI, HWHM, and distal-compartment voltage. Ih
is a known resonance and input-impedance shaper that could partly explain why distal diameter
reads flat on both t0022 and t0024 (t0030 and t0035 both null). If ablation of Ih causes the
diameter sweep to become non-flat, h-current is masking the mechanism. Distinct from S-0009-03
which targeted Ih calibration, not ablation. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

t0029 (distal-length sweep) and t0030 (distal-diameter sweep) both produced flat vector-sum
DSI curves when run in isolation on the t0022 E-I schedule. Marginal sweeps cannot reveal
interactions: Schachter2010's active amplification depends on length (number of Nav-bearing
segments) AND diameter (Nav substrate per unit length) jointly, and the cable space constant
lambda = sqrt(d * Rm / (4 * Ra)) couples them nonlinearly. Run a focused 2-D grid (e.g., 5
length x 5 diameter = 25 configurations x 12 angles x 10 trials = 3000 trials) on the
schedule-fixed testbed (S-0030-01 prerequisite). Distinct from S-0002-04 (broad factorial
including branch orders at fixed synapse count) because it is 2-D, focused, and scheduled
after the desaturation fix. Expected local CPU wall time ~7 h. Recommended task types:

t0030 applied a single multiplier uniformly to every distal leaf, producing a 4x range that
Schachter2010's 150-200 MOhm proximal -> >1 GOhm distal (5-7x) impedance gradient indicates is
too narrow and the wrong shape. Real DSGC dendrites taper from thick primary branches to thin
terminal tips; the uniform multiplier scales all terminals together without recreating that
gradient. Implement a taper parameter k such that a segment's diameter scales by (1 + k *
path_distance / L_max), sweep k in {-0.5, -0.25, 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75} to produce flattened,
nominal, and exaggerated tapers, and run the standard 12-direction x 10-trial protocol at each
k (after the S-0030-01 schedule fix). Expected outcome: the exaggerated-taper cell (high k,
very thin distal) maximises distal input impedance and should exhibit the Schachter2010
amplification signature if the mechanism is active on this morphology. Recommended task types:

principled way to match impedance across a binary tree; our max-child Strahler bins have no
such guarantee. Implement TREES-toolbox's quaddiameter algorithm as ~80 lines of pure Python,
solve the system bottom-up from the 131 terminals with the Poleg-Polsky terminal mean fixed,
and produce a sibling asset dsgc-baseline-morphology-rall. Compare against the
Strahler-calibrated asset by per-branch axial resistance, total surface area, and
per-compartment radius deltas. Expected primary-radius shift ~15% (3.69 to ~3.1 um) at the

t0034's classify_shape.py assigns a categorical label (monotonic/saturating/non-monotonic) but
does not fit a parametric cable-theory model to the observed DSI vs length curve. Vector-sum
DSI declines monotonically from 0.507 (0.5x) to 0.357 (2.0x) with R^2=0.91, and peak firing
declines 40% across the sweep - both quantitative cable-filtering signatures. Write a
dedicated analysis task that fits (a) the Rall 1/d^(3/2) impedance-matching rule to the
peak-Hz decline, (b) Tukker2004's lambda-optimum function to the DSI vs length curve (extract
the fitted lambda at peak DSI), and (c) Hausselt2007's cable-length-to-DSI scaling. Output a
fitted parameter set with 95% CIs and a residual plot. This converts t0034's categorical
'cable-filtering best fit' into a falsifiable quantitative claim and enables direct
cross-paper comparison. Recommended task types: data-analysis.

tie-break; a min-child or NeuroM section-based convention can push max_order to 6 and
reclassify the current 33 primary compartments as mid, jumping proximal Rin by ~15%
(creative_thinking.md section F3, E1). Produce 3-4 sibling calibrated SWCs under alternative
tie-break rules (max-child, min-child, NeuroM section_strahler_orders, two-bin collapse) and
run the downstream DSGC passive simulation from S-0009-01 on each. Report DSI, preferred peak,
HWHM, and proximal/distal Rin per variant; quantify the sensitivity of downstream metrics to
the heuristic choice. This makes the tie-break choice reviewable rather than arbitrary.

The t0030 sweep used multipliers 0.5x-2.0x (a 4x range) and found vector-sum DSI moved by only
0.030 absolute, with Wu2023 reporting distal-diameter DSI saturation above ~0.8 um on primate
SAC - our baseline distal seg.diam straddles that threshold so our sweep likely sat in the
saturated regime throughout. Once the S-0030-01/S-0030-02 schedule fix has removed the DSI
ceiling, rerun the diameter sweep over a wider range {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0,
4.0}x at the same 12-direction x 10-trial protocol. Provides the impedance-gradient dynamic
range Schachter2010's 5-7x proximal-to-distal input-resistance measurement implies, and tests
whether Wu2023's saturation threshold applies to mouse ON-OFF DSGC. Recommended task types:
experiment-run.

The t0022 testbed currently has no Ih (HCN) channels in DEND_CHANNELS. Literature prior from
t0019 (voltage-gated-channels survey) flags Ih as a common dendritic modulator: it lowers
input resistance and shortens the E-I temporal window over which coincidence matters. Add Ih
at a realistic dendritic density (e.g., 1e-5 S/cm^2 following hippocampal CA1 values as a
start) to the DEND_CHANNELS forsec block and rerun the canonical 12-angle x 10-trial sweep
plus an EI_OFFSET sweep in {5, 10, 15, 20, 30} ms. Expected outcome: the E-I integration
window narrows (only tight E-I offsets produce DSI, long offsets stop working), quantifying
the dendritic-integration timescale imposed by Ih. Dependencies: t0022 library asset,
S-0022-03 infrastructure for EI offset sweeps if already done. Effort ~10 hours. Recommended
task type: experiment-run.

Every compartment in the downloaded CNG SWC carries the placeholder radius 0.125 um because
the original Simple Neurite Tracer reconstruction did not record diameters. Cable-theory
predicts segment diameter is the single most influential local-electrotonic knob (see
S-0002-04), so leaving the uniform placeholder in place will silently bias every downstream
biophysical simulation (axial resistance, attenuation, spike initiation threshold). Build a
diameter-calibration pipeline that applies a literature-derived order-dependent diameter taper
(e.g., Vaney/Sivyer/Taylor 2012 mouse ON-OFF DSGC profile, or the Poleg-Polsky 2016
distribution) keyed on Strahler order or path distance from the soma, write the calibrated SWC
as a new dataset asset (e.g., dsgc-baseline-morphology-calibrated), and report the per-order
diameter distribution against the original placeholder. Recommended task types:
feature-engineering, data-analysis.

t0030's diameter sweep was uninformative because DSI was pinned at 1.000 (null firing = 0 Hz
at 12 nS GABA). With 4 nS, the t0037 sweet spot, the t0022 testbed produces biologically
realistic DSI (0.429) and preferred direction (40 deg). Rerun the original 7-diameter sweep
(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 um) with GABA_CONDUCTANCE_NULL_NS=4.0 to measure the
Schachter2010-vs-passive-filtering slope that has been the project's headline discriminator
target since t0030.
