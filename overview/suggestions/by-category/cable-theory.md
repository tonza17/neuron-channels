Every compartment in the downloaded CNG SWC carries the placeholder radius 0.125 um because
the original Simple Neurite Tracer reconstruction did not record diameters. Cable-theory
predicts segment diameter is the single most influential local-electrotonic knob (see
S-0002-04), so leaving the uniform placeholder in place will silently bias every downstream
biophysical simulation (axial resistance, attenuation, spike initiation threshold). Build a
diameter-calibration pipeline that applies a literature-derived order-dependent diameter taper
(e.g., Vaney/Sivyer/Taylor 2012 mouse ON-OFF DSGC profile, or the Poleg-Polsky 2016
distribution) keyed on Strahler order or path distance from the soma, write the calibrated SWC
as a new dataset asset (e.g., dsgc-baseline-morphology-calibrated), and report the per-order
diameter distribution against the original placeholder. Recommended task types:
feature-engineering, data-analysis.
