The t0059 negative result (max FULL peak Hz = 2.143, max vector-sum DSI = 0.209) most
plausibly stems from passive dendrites capping local depolarisation; Park2014 [p. 3977] and
PolegPolsky2016 [p. 1278] both implicitly assume active dendritic mechanisms. Fork
minimal_dsgc_bar_locked_gaba_ampa_sweep, install Nav1.6 (g_Nabar in {0.05, 0.10, 0.20} S/cm^2)
and Kv3 (g_Kv3bar in {0.05, 0.10} S/cm^2) on dendritic sections, and run a focused 3x2x3
(gNa_dend x gKv3_dend x gAMPA in {1.0, 2.0, 4.0}) sweep at GABA_BASE_NS = 0.10 nS (the t0059
vector-sum DSI optimum). Pass criterion: at least one operating point with peak Hz >= 5 Hz AND
vector-sum DSI > 0.3. Distinct from S-0009-03 (calibrates densities against PolegPolsky2016
spike-shape and Ih-sag waveforms only) and S-0002-01 (somatic g_Na/g_K only). Directly
addresses RQ4 on the bar-locked substrate. Recommended task types: build-model,

Kv7 was inert at all 3 somatic densities tested in t0074 (vector-sum DSI delta < 0.003 at
every density). Compare-literature confirmed this matches Hu 2007 / Shah 2008's prediction
that Kv7's canonical site is the AIS, not the soma. Build a virtual AIS section on Bed A (30
µm, between soma and virtual axon, with HHst at 5x somatic density), and re-run the 3-density
Kv7 sweep with insertion on the AIS rather than the soma. This was already proposed as the
t0075 candidate in earlier brainstorming (S-0067-03). Hypothesis: Kv7_AIS at 0.001-0.005
mS/cm² produces a measurable change in either HWHM or vector-sum DSI; M-current's slow
accumulation is well-suited to the AIS firing regime.

t0084's fractional-channel-contribution metric is correlative: it measures which channel's
PD-vs-ND integrated current differs most in absolute magnitude, but does not establish causal
contribution to DSI. Replace it with a counterfactual knockout metric: for each cell, run 4
conditions (full / NMDA-knockout / Nav1.6-knockout / NaP-knockout) across 8 directions and
compute `delta_DSI = DSI_full - DSI_knockout` per channel. The dominant mechanism is the
channel whose knockout collapses DSI the most. Apply to cells 767 / 637 / 762; if NaP-knockout
collapses DSI by the most, t0084's NaP-dominant correlative finding is causally confirmed;
otherwise the attribution shifts. ~96 runs on local CPU. Distinct from S-0084-01 which sweeps
NaP density continuously; S-0084-05 tests all three channels simultaneously with binary
on/off. Recommended task types: experiment-run, data-analysis.

t0068 reported that Nav1.6 + Kv3 co-expression jointly rescues DSI and rate, but the t0076
25-d Pareto front contains no cell with DSI>=0.6 AND rate>=40 Hz at any (Nav1.6, Kv3)
combination. The contradiction is either (a) substrate-specific (t0068 used Bed A; t0076 used
Bed B); (b) a t0068 local-minimum that wider search escaped; or (c) the other 23 t0076
parameters destructively interfere with the rescue. Resolve by fixing the t0076 iter-424
best-joint cell (DSI=0.42, rate=4.95 Hz) and sweeping ONLY (Nav1.6, Kv3) over the t0068 grid
(5x5 densities, both substrates). Compare: does the rescue appear on Bed B at this fixed
background? Does it disappear on Bed A when the other 23 t0076-style parameters are perturbed
away from t0068 defaults? Recommended task types: experiment-run.

t0067 showed NaP at 0.8 mS/cm² gives DSI = 0.117 (positive but low) and at 2.4 mS/cm² gives
DSI = -0.179 (inverted). The exact crossing density is between 0.8 and 2.4 mS/cm². Run a finer
5-point density sweep on NaP only (e.g., 0.8, 1.0, 1.3, 1.7, 2.4 mS/cm²) with 10 seeds each
(~25 min compute) to characterise the DSI-vs-NaP-density transition curve and identify the
threshold density at which directional inversion becomes statistically robust. This is the
most surprising finding from t0067 and warrants quantitative refinement.

S-0057-06 covers Mg-block NMDA + tonic GABA but uses t0057's global (100, 1400) ms tonic
window and fixed gAMPA = 0.5 nS. t0059 demonstrates the bar-locked window mechanism delivers
an 8.5 ms direction-dependent IPSP centre-of-mass shift (REQ-13 PASS) the global window
cannot. Layering Mg-block NMDA on the bar-locked substrate combines all three plausible
gap-closers identified in compare-literature: voltage-dependent NMDA gain (PolegPolsky2016),
per-synapse bar-arrival timing (deRosenroll2026), and AMPA escape. Fork

t0084 attributed cells 767/637/762 PD-vs-ND integrated dendritic current asymmetry to NaP
sustained depolarisation (93.0% / 98.5% / 99.9% fractional contributions) but the metric is
correlative. Test causality by sweeping `nap_dend_distal` from its measured value down through
0 in 5 logarithmic steps for each of the three cells while holding all other 53 parameters
fixed; re-evaluate per-direction spike counts and DSI. If joint-pass DSI collapses when
nap_dend_distal=0, NaP is causally necessary; if DSI is preserved, NaP is correlative only.
Reuse t0084's run_deepdive driver. ~45 runs locally on CPU. Cost ~$0. Recommended task types:

SK_high produced HWHM = 41 deg (delta -42 deg, the largest narrowing in the sweep).
Creative-thinking flagged that this could be a flat-top clipping artefact rather than true
narrowing: if SK acts as a firing-rate ceiling, the curve becomes flat-topped near the peak
and HWHM becomes ill-defined. Resolution requires a per-condition polar curve plot for SK_high
(and as a control, SK_med, SK_low, baseline). Cost: ~30 min coding using the existing t0011
plot_polar_tuning_curve. If polar plot shows flat-top with sharp shoulders, the narrowing is a
clipping artefact; if it shows a true narrow bell, the effect is real and SK_high is
biologically interesting. This is purely an analysis task on the existing per_trial_full.csv —
no new sim runs.

Refactor the minimal-DSGC trial code (forked across t0052/t0053/t0054/t0055) to replace the
legacy FULL/E_ONLY/GABA_ONLY trio with a FULL/EPSP_PASSIVE/IPSP_PASSIVE trio. EPSP_PASSIVE and
IPSP_PASSIVE must save-and-zero soma+AIS gnabar_hh and gkbar_hh so the recorded EPSP and IPSP
traces are clean synaptic envelopes, not spike-contaminated traces (the user-flagged bug that
made t0054 REQ-20 and t0055 REQ-20 return null at every gNMDA). Drop the per-synapse
activation-time histogram. Confirm and standardize the trial length with the user (1400 vs
1500 ms vs longer window for EPSP-decay metrics; 3000-5000 ms recommended by S-0054-03). Pass
criterion: EPSP/IPSP traces from a representative gNMDA value show no Na+ spikes; HH-on FULL
trace is unchanged within 1e-6 mV vs current code. Recommended task types: write-library,

Real RGC AIS diameters cluster around 0.4-0.8 μm; t0069 used 1 μm. A narrower AIS has higher
input resistance per unit area, so the same gbar of an AIS-localised Nav or Kv channel
produces a much larger local depolarisation. Test: rebuild the AIS at diam=0.5 μm (keep L=30
μm), keep all other parameters identical to t0069, re-run the 16-condition × 2-direction ×
5-seed sweep. Combined with S-0069-01 (halved somatic Na), this should be the configuration
that finally exposes AIS-localised Kv3 / Kv4 effects. Compute: ~10 min.

REQ-10 follow-up. The t0076 25-d search applied each of 12 channel densities uniformly across
soma + 350 dendrites. Real RGCs have ~50x higher Nav at AIS than soma (Kole 2008) and graded
Ih/Kv distributions per dendritic tier. Re-run the BoTorch MOBO with channels stratified into
4 region tiers (soma, proximal-dendrite, mid-dendrite, terminal), expanding the input to
~40-50 d. Seed the new GP with the 12-cell t0076 Pareto front (uniform-density solutions).
Test whether tier-stratification breaks the inherent DSI-vs-rate trade-off observed in the
25-d search. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

Cumulative project evidence (t0054, t0055, t0057) converges on PolegPolsky2016's argument that
voltage-dependent NMDA Mg-block is necessary for non-trivial DSI. t0055 added Mg-block NMDA
but kept scalar gabaMOD inhibition; t0057 swapped inhibition to tonic but kept AMPA-only
excitation. Neither tested the combination. Build a minimal architecture combining (a) AMPA +
Jahr-Stevens Mg-block NMDA (t0055 NMDA_MgBlock.mod) on each E synapse and (b) tonic GABA via
gaba_tonic.mod (t0057) with the t0053 spatial centripetal gating predicate on each I synapse.

NaR_med and NaR_high broadened HWHM by +34 / +36 deg without changing peak rate or vector-sum
DSI. Creative-thinking hypothesised NaR's slow `s` reactivation gate creates a sub-threshold
floor that pushes ND-direction firing above zero, broadening the curve symmetrically. Test:
load per_trial_full.csv, filter rows where condition_id in (nar_high, nar_med, baseline) and
angle in (90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240) deg, count trials with n_spikes > 0. Hypothesis
confirmed if NaR_high has > 30% of trials firing at angle 90-180 deg vs baseline ~5%. Cost:
pure-data analysis, no new sims (~15 min coding). If confirmed, NaR is a natural candidate for
AIS-localised follow-up since AIS-localised NaR could selectively boost ND firing without
affecting PD.

from the committed 25 (3 Cuntz scalars: bf, distal-length, distal-diameter + gNa_dend +
gKdr_dend), (b) run 200-300 deterministic 12-angle evaluations each under CMA-ES and
sequential BO, (c) compare the DSI converged-to-within-1% sample count against the cost-grid
extrapolations, and (d) report whether either method actually converges on DSGC landscapes or

The t0076 high-rate Pareto extreme (iter 319, 127.75 Hz) exceeds biological mean PD rates
(30-80 Hz) precisely because Bed B lacks a slow-adaptation mechanism. The vendored SK and BK
mechanisms (from cortical/Purkinje sources) and the single-shell `cad` Ca pool (taur=5 ms)
collectively fail to cap firing on the timescale real RGCs use. Vendor a slow-AHP (e.g., SK_E2
with longer Ca-binding time, or a dedicated KAHP mechanism) and re-evaluate a 5-cell subsample
of the t0076 Pareto front: does the high-rate end of the Pareto front contract toward
physiological rates? Does a slow AHP open a new DSI>=0.4 + rate>=30 Hz region? This is a
focussed mechanism-addition test, not a full MOBO re-run. Recommended task types:

Author a new MOD mechanism (or extend `bipolarNMDA.mod`) that selectively blocks NMDAR
conductance in dendritic compartments while leaving somatic NMDAR + AMPA intact, mirroring the
paper's intracellular MK801 (iMK801) protocol. The current AP5 analogue used in t0046
(`b2gnmda = 0`) removes ALL NMDAR contribution and silences the cell entirely (DSI = 0 under
AP5); the paper's iMK801 leaves PD spiking, allowing the qualitative 'DSI preserved under AP5'
Fig 8 claim to be reproduced. This unblocks a faithful Fig 8 AP5 reproduction and resolves the
AP5-vs-iMK801 mechanistic divergence catalogued as discrepancy 1 of 12 in t0046's audit.

Our V_rest sweep shows t0022 loses tuning at depolarised V_rest (DSI 0.046 at V=-30 mV) while
t0024 stays flat (DSI>=0.36). Two candidate mechanisms are Na channel inactivation and NMDA
Mg-block relief. Run the sweep once with TTX-like Na-block (g_Na=0) and once with NMDA-block
(g_NMDA=0) to isolate which channel class drives each model's V_rest sensitivity.

The de Rosenroll 2026 schema places NaP on the AIS but the v3 substrate (t0080) places NaP on
terminal dendrites instead. t0084 found NaP-dominant attribution at the terminal dendrite, but
the dominant-mechanism story may differ if NaP were instead on the AIS. Test by holding cells
767 / 637 / 762 parameters fixed but moving NaP from terminal_dends to ais_distal at the same
density, and re-evaluating DSI / PD rate / fractional contribution. Hypothesis: AIS-localised
NaP would shift dominance toward Nav1.6 or NMDA at the dendrite. Local CPU; 48 runs. Cost ~$0.

BK and SK produced very similar narrowing patterns at low / med densities (delta_HWHM ~ -0.2
to -7 deg, delta_vec_DSI ~ -0.02 to -0.05 — within 1 SD of each other). Creative-thinking
proposed they may share a Ca-pool-driven mechanism. Test: 4-condition co-expression sweep —
{BK_med, SK_med, BK_med + SK_med, baseline} × 12 angles × 5 seeds = 240 trials, ~10 min
compute. If BK + SK co-expression delta equals the linear sum of single-channel deltas, the
channels are non-interacting (different downstream effects); if the combined delta saturates
near the larger single-channel delta, they share a Ca-pool-driven mechanism. Either outcome
teaches us about BK / SK co-expression in DSGCs and informs the t0075 dendritic-active
follow-up.

Geometry alone does not recover the Schachter Rin targets; the residual gap needs active and
passive membrane parameters. On dsgc-baseline-morphology-calibrated, install Fohlmeister-like
Nav, delayed-rectifier Kv, and Ih channels and fit their densities (somatic vs dendritic) so
that (1) the somatic action-potential shape (halfwidth, peak, afterhyperpolarisation) matches
Poleg-Polsky 2016 Figure 2, and (2) the voltage-sag response to hyperpolarising current at
distal tips matches the Ih-driven sag amplitude reported in Schachter 2010. This is distinct
from S-0002-01 (DSI-maximising g_Na/g_K grid) and S-0002-02 (passive-vs-active DSI ablation):
it tunes channel densities against single-cell electrophysiological waveforms, not tuning
curves. Output: a library asset exposing the fitted mechanism list for reuse in the DSI
experiments. Recommended task types: experiment-run, feature-engineering.

S-0068-04 already proposed AIS Nav1.6 + Kv3 co-insertion. t0069's baseline-quenching means a
naive co-insertion sweep on the unweakened soma will likely also be inert. So this should run
AFTER S-0069-01 (somatic Na halved). Test 4 conditions on the t0069 substrate with halved
somatic Na: {Nav1.6_med + Kv3_med, Nav1.6_med + Kv3_high, Nav1.6_high + Kv3_med, Nav1.6_high +
Kv3_high} on AIS × PD/ND × 5 seeds = 40 trials. Hypothesis: with a weakened soma and the
natural fast-spiking AIS recipe (Nav1.6 + Kv3), the cell becomes more like a real fast-firing
RGC and DSI becomes higher (or more controllable) than the t0067 single-channel sweep showed.

Peak somatic firing rate in t0029 steps from 15 Hz at multipliers <= 1.0x to 14 Hz at
multipliers >= 1.25x with no intermediate value, and mean peak membrane voltage drifts
linearly from -4.81 mV (1.0x) to -5.23 mV (2.0x) - a 0.42 mV loss scaling linearly with length
rather than as exp(-L/lambda). A linear drop is inconsistent with passive cable attenuation
but consistent with distal synapses sitting beyond an active boosting region whose gain
depends on spatial proximity (Poleg-Polsky2016 distal Nav/Cav contribution). Add a dense
7-point sweep at {1.00, 1.05, 1.10, 1.15, 1.20, 1.25, 1.30} to resolve whether the 15->14 Hz
step is smooth (passive) or sharp (local threshold crossing, i.e. Sivyer-like signature).
Record both peak Hz and mean peak somatic voltage at each point. Recommended task types:

HWHM in t0029 oscillates non-monotonically across length multipliers (71.7 deg at 1.5x vs
115.8 deg at 1.75-2.0x), inconsistent with any passive cable theory and consistent with distal
Nav channels crossing or failing to cross dendritic-spike threshold at a critical length.
Rerun the 7-point length sweep with distal Nav channels ablated (`forsec DEND_CHANNELS {
gnabar_HHst = 0 }`) while keeping somatic and AIS Nav intact. If HWHM becomes monotonic with
length, the non-monotonicity is a Sivyer2013 dendritic-spike signature and active boosting is
the dominant mechanism. If HWHM still oscillates, the non-monotonicity is passive cable
resonance and Sivyer2013 can be provisionally rejected on this morphology. Pairs naturally
with S-0029-01 to form a 2x2 design (Nav ablation x Poisson noise). One-line HOC overlay. ~45

t0036 recorded per-trial scalar distal peak_mv only (~-55 mV at null direction) but did not
export the full distal membrane time course. Creative_thinking hypothesis 4 (distal Nav
channels sub-threshold at null regardless of diameter amplification) and limitation bullet 5
both flag missing voltage traces as blocking direct mechanistic confirmation. Extend the t0022
trial driver to save a 200-sample time-course of the most-distal compartment voltage (one
trial per direction at diameter 1.0x, GABA_NULL = 6 nS and 12 nS, 24 traces total, ~5 min
CPU). Plot v_distal(t) across directions and annotate Nav activation threshold (~-55 mV) and
AMPA/GABA event onsets. Expected: at null the distal membrane never crosses Nav threshold for
the whole AMPA window on either 6 nS or 12 nS; at preferred it crosses and fires. Closes
creative_thinking hypothesis 4 and confirms the sub-threshold-clamp failure mode. Recommended

AIS, Kv1 subunit expression at AIS, RGC HH-family kinetic rate functions, Nav1.6 vs Nav1.2
co-expression kinetics, AIS Nav conductance density) but with one classical paper per theme. A
follow-up survey task should add ~5 DSGC-targeted papers across: (a) DSGC-specific Nav/Kv
patch-clamp measurements at near-physiological temperature, (b) super-resolution microscopy of
AIS microdomains (panNav vs subtype-specific antibodies, STED/STORM), (c) developmental Nav/Kv
channel trajectory studies in RGC AIS, (d) M-current/Kv7/KCNQ channels at RGC AIS, (e) Kv3
fast-delayed-rectifier measurements in RGC. This closes the gap between canonical
voltage-gated-channel theory and DSGC-specific parameters.

is a known resonance and input-impedance shaper that could partly explain why distal diameter
reads flat on both t0022 and t0024 (t0030 and t0035 both null). If ablation of Ih causes the
diameter sweep to become non-flat, h-current is masking the mechanism. Distinct from S-0009-03

The t0078 compare_literature step found iter 81's nav16_ais collapsed to the search floor
(1e-5 S/cm^2), four orders below Kole 2008's [0.25, 0.5] S/cm^2 prior and five orders below
Werginz 2024's mouse alpha-RGC value of 1.3 S/cm^2. AIS-to-soma Nav ratio at iter 81 was
5.5e-5 vs Werginz 2024's measured 17.3. The optimiser found a configuration where the AIS
contributes nothing to spike initiation, contradicting REQ-2 / REQ-3 / REQ-4's biological
intent. This may be a generalisable MOBO-on-biophysics failure mode. Document: (a) audit t0076
+ t0078 Pareto fronts for similar collapse-to-floor patterns on biologically-priored
parameters; (b) propose log-uniform priors with hard biological lower bounds as default for
future MOBO tasks; (c) write up as an answer asset. Pass: produce an answer asset with a
checklist of biological priors to enforce as hard constraints in future MOBO tasks.

Kv3 was inert at all 3 densities at our peak rates (~20 Hz baseline). Literature (Rudy &
McBain 2001) says Kv3 engages strongly above 100 Hz. NaP_high produced a 74 Hz peak rate — the
highest in the sweep. Co-expression of Kv3 with NaP should put us in Kv3's effective regime.
Test: 4 conditions {NaP_high, NaP_high + Kv3_low, NaP_high + Kv3_med, NaP_high + Kv3_high} ×
12 angles × 5 seeds = 240 trials, ~10 min compute. Hypothesis: Kv3 co-expression with NaP_high
partially rescues DSI by providing fast repolarisation, allowing the cell to recover between
PD spikes and reducing the depolarisation block we hypothesised in creative-thinking.

Kole & Letzkus 2007 report that Kv1 in the proximal AIS sets spike threshold while Kv3 in the
distal AIS sets repolarisation speed and thus maximum sustained firing rate. Use the t0022
AIS_PROXIMAL and AIS_DISTAL forsec blocks to implement four conditions: (a) Kv1 proximal + Kv3
distal (canonical), (b) Kv1 distal + Kv3 proximal (swap), (c) Kv1 both (no Kv3), (d) Kv3 both
(no Kv1), each with Nav1.6 held at 8 S/cm^2 in the distal AIS. Rerun the 12-angle x 10-trial
sweep for each condition. Expected outcome: condition (a) peaks near 30-40 Hz; condition (b)
drops peak because distal Kv1 fails to fast-repolarise; conditions (c) and (d) test whether
either K-channel alone suffices. Dependencies: t0022 library asset. Effort ~16 hours.

Kv4 / IA was inert at all 3 densities. Compare-literature: Kv4's V_half_h is -50 mV; the
DSGC's resting potential is -60 mV, which is below V_half_h, so Kv4 sits inactivated at rest.
To engage Kv4, a brief hyperpolarising prepulse (~50 ms at -80 mV) before the bar-rotation
stimulus would remove inactivation. Modify the run_sweep.py protocol to include a 50 ms
pre-pulse window; re-run the 3-density Kv4 sweep (3 conditions × 12 angles × 5 seeds = 180
trials, ~6 min compute). Hypothesis: with the prepulse, Kv4 produces measurable HWHM narrowing
and peak-rate suppression at high density. If confirmed, Kv4 is biologically active in DSGCs
but only after recent hyperpolarisation — relevant for understanding ON-OFF DSGCs that
experience hyperpolarising rebounds between stimulus presentations.

Real RGCs concentrate Nav1.6 and Kv3 at the AIS at ~50x somatic densities. The Nav1.6 + Kv3
co-localisation we modelled here is somatic, which the t0067 / t0068 limitations document as
understating the joint effect. Add a 30-um AIS section to the deposited cell, place Nav1.6 +
Kv3 there at 30 / 90 mS/cm^2 (and a wider Kv3 density grid up to ~200 mS/cm^2), re-run the
rescue sweep. Expected: AIS-localised Kv3 at very high density may finally show DSI rescue
because the AIS's smaller diameter makes per-segment conductance changes leverage the AP shape
more strongly. If still no rescue, the channel-pharmacology approach to DSI rescue is null
across substrates.

t0084's attribution metric records Nav1.6 and NaP currents only at `cell.terminal_dends[0]`
(representative section). Test whether this is representative by extending recording to all
177 terminal dendrite sections of cell 767 and recomputing per-section fractional
contribution. If per-section spread is small (all > 80% NaP-dominant), single-section
attribution is robust; if some sections show NMDA-dominant or Nav1.6-dominant local
contributions, there is dendrite-tree spatial heterogeneity that the single-section metric
obscures, reframing t0084 from 'NaP-dominant cell-wide' to 'NaP-dominant on average with
possible NMDA hotspots'. Local CPU; runtime increase ~10 minutes. Cost ~$0. Recommended task
types: experiment-run, data-analysis.

Use the t0022 modeldb_189347_dsgc_dendritic library's AIS_PROXIMAL forsec block to append a
proximal axon segment populated with Nav1.1 at ~7x somatic density, then knock it out (set
gbar to 0) and rerun the canonical 12-angle x 10-trial sweep. VanWart2006 reports Nav1.1
dominates the proximal AIS while Nav1.6 dominates the distal AIS; removing proximal Nav1.1
should drop excitability and test whether DSI survives reduced spike-initiation margin.
Expected outcome: peak rate drops below 10 Hz while DSI holds above 0.5 (inhibitory shunt
intact, spike threshold only moved). Dependencies: t0022 library asset. Effort ~6 hours.

Sweep Nav1.6 density in the AIS_DISTAL forsec block over {4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16} S/cm^2
(centred on the Kole-Stuart 2008 ~8 S/cm^2 published anchor) with Kv1.2 held constant, rerun
the 12-angle x 10-trial sweep at each setting, and report peak firing rate vs Nav1.6 density.
Peak-rate cap at 10-20 Hz is shared across t0008 (18.1 Hz), t0020 (14.85 Hz), and t0022 (15
Hz) and is inherited from the unchanged t0008 HHst Na/K density, so the fix lives in the
distal AIS. Expected outcome: peak rate scales monotonically with Nav1.6 density and lands
inside 30-40 Hz at ~8 S/cm^2, matching Poleg-Polsky & Diamond 2016 and Oesch2005.

Research-internet gap 2 showed that the upstream repository has no explicit AIS section, but
research-papers (Werginz 2020, Van Wart 2007) pins the AIS-to-soma Na ratio at ~7x and names
AIS length as the dominant predictor of maximum sustained firing rate. Fork t0024 into a new
library asset, add a two-subsegment AIS (proximal Nav1.2/Nav1.1, distal Nav1.6 + Kv1.2) with
Na ratio 7x and AIS length 25-50 um, rerun the 8-direction correlated/uncorrelated protocol,
and compare peak firing rate and HWHM to the t0024 baseline. Does not require rebuilding the

t0078's 49-d run revealed that several parameters consistently land at floors or ceilings
across the full BoTorch trajectory, suggesting they carry little Pareto information. Audit
t0078's per-parameter posterior-quantile distributions and t0080's per-parameter Pareto-cell
values; drop the 10-15 parameters with the narrowest effective ranges (e.g., parameters whose
5th-95th percentile across feasible cells spans <10% of bounded range). Re-run NSGA-II on the
pruned 30-40 d substrate at pop=24 / gen=8 to confirm that the dimensionality-vs-budget
mismatch is the dominant negative-result driver. Cost ~$0.75 (similar budget to t0080 but
smaller search space should converge faster). Recommended task types: experiment-run,

t0034 attributed the primary-DSI non-monotonicity and preferred-angle jumps (to 330 deg at
1.5x, to 30 deg at 2.0x) to Schachter2010 local-spike-failure in distal compartments, based
only on the somatic readout and the angular-instability fingerprint. This interpretation is
currently suggestive but not confirmed. Re-run the t0034 sweep with per-compartment V
recording at every distal terminal (177 sections) and compute the distal-to-soma spike-count
ratio per trial per angle. Under Schachter2010 local-spike-failure, the ratio should be >1 at
baseline (reliable distal spikes) and drop below 1 at 1.5x and 2.0x where cable length
decouples distal tips. If the ratio stays constant, the angle jumps are not a
local-spike-failure signature and another mechanism (NMDA recruitment, Kv3 rectification)
should be explored. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

t0072's per-synapse recordings surfaced a counter-intuitive Bed A finding: mean peak g_NMDA is
0.30 nS at PD vs 0.19 nS at ND (~37% drop) despite identical BIPsyn release envelopes between
directions. The mechanism is the Jahr-Stevens Mg block: stronger ND inhibition keeps dendritic
v more hyperpolarised, deepening the voltage-dependent block and lowering realised gNMDA. Run
a focused 2-D sweep on the Bed A substrate (t0008/t0020 builder) varying (gabaMOD, [Mg2+]_o)
over a 5x5 grid at fixed PD/ND bar geometry, recording per-synapse g_NMDA and v_local with the
same recorder pattern as t0072, and producing the surface (g_NMDA_ND - g_NMDA_PD) vs (gabaMOD
ratio, [Mg2+]_o). Cross-check against a Voff_bipNMDA = 1 control (voltage-independent NMDA
from t0048) which should flatten the surface to ~0. Distinct from S-0026-06 (V_rest

Authoring all equations side-by-side in one document made four numeric divergences between Bed
A and Bed B unambiguous (rows 7, 9, 16, 17 of the comparison table in
`results_detailed.md:L778-L799`): `celsius` 32 vs 36.9 deg C (HHst gating tau differs ~2x via
Q10), `v_init` -65 vs -60 mV (shifts Mg-block operating point and Na inactivation), NMDA
on/off (S-0070-04 wires it on but does NOT pick a target value), CaL+CaT zeroed/default
(S-0070-03 turns Bed A's Ca on but does NOT pick a target). Run a 4-condition factorial sweep
on Bed A's t0065 protocol toggling `celsius in {32, 36.9}` x `v_init in {-65, -60}` to
quantify how much of the observed Bed A vs Bed B DSI / peak-Hz / EPSP-envelope difference is
attributable to these two non-Ca, non-NMDA conventions alone — the result decides whether
project-wide convention harmonisation is needed before S-0070-01..04 can be interpreted.

(`tasks/t0008_port_modeldb_189347/assets/library/modeldb_189347_dsgc/sources/main.hoc:L155-L156`),
removing the L-type and T-type Ca currents that are present in the original Poleg-Polsky 2016
paper. Bed B inherits the same `glbar_HHst = 3e-4` and `gtbar_HHst = 3e-4 S/cm^2` PARAMETER
defaults (`HHst_noiseless.mod:L57-L58`) on every section because its Python builder never
overrides them. This is the single most visible biophysical divergence between the two beds.
Run a controlled experiment: re-enable Bed A's Ca currents at the `HHst.mod` defaults (and at
the Bed B densities), re-run the t0065 EPSP/IPSP/FULL protocol, and report changes in DSI,
peak firing rate, and EPSP/IPSP envelopes. The result either justifies harmonising the two
beds on the same Ca configuration or documents a biophysically motivated reason to keep them
divergent. Recommended task types: experiment-run, comparative-analysis.

The t0078 high-DSI rail's PD ceiling at 2.86 Hz held flat across 109 acquisitions despite
optimiser exploration, the signature of a saturated negative-feedback loop. The 20x upper
bound corresponds to tau_ca ~ 100 ms; Larsson 2013 reports mammalian sAHP decay on the 1-3 s
timescale, equivalent to multiplier values of ~ 100-300x. The originally-proposed [1, 200x]
bound was reduced to [1, 20x] by researcher decision pre-launch as a simulation-budget safety
margin. Hypothesis: at multiplier > 20x the slow-Kv regime engages and may (a) free the PD
ceiling on the high-DSI rail or (b) not change behaviour (confirming saturation is
mechanistic, not parametric). Bundle with S-0078-01 if NSGA-II is run, or run as a focused

t0074 covered Bed A only. Bed B (de-Rosenroll 2026, t0024 library) has different morphology,
different synapse placement, and a built-in Ca pool — meaning the channel-level findings here
may not generalise to Bed B. Repeat the same 25-condition × 12-angle × 5-seed sweep on Bed B.
Cost: same ~70 min compute as t0074. Comparison points: which channels remain inert; whether
NaP-induced DSI loss reproduces; whether SK_high HWHM narrowing reproduces (or is a
Bed-A-specific artefact); whether the with-cad baseline DSI shift seen in Bed A is also seen
in Bed B (where cad is native). This is a cross-substrate validation that strengthens any
conclusions drawn from t0074.

t0067's 5 MOD files use simplified HH-style m/h gates with V_half and time constants from
published values, but lose features specific to each channel: NaR's blocking-particle
mechanism (Khaliq-Raman 2003 uses a 5-state Markov scheme), Kv3 inactivation kinetics
(Wang-Buzsaki 1996 has a two-component decay), Kv4 voltage-dependent recovery (Hoffman 1997
has a recovery time constant tau_h(v) that varies 5-fold across V). NaR/Kv3/Kv4 in particular
showed almost no effect in t0067, possibly because the simplified kinetics miss their
distinctive features. Vendor the canonical ModelDB MOD files for these 3 channels (matching
the deposited cell's USEION conventions or wrapping in NONSPECIFIC_CURRENT shells) and re-run
the sweep. Expected: NaR/Kv3/Kv4 show real DSI effects, especially at high firing rates (>40
Hz).

Re-run a small diameter sweep (0.5x, 1.0x, 2.0x) on the t0024 DSGC with gnabar_HHst rescaled
by 1/d in the distal compartments so the total per-section Nav count is held fixed as diameter
varies. Creative_thinking hypothesis 2 proposes that the flat DSI-vs-diameter result (t0035)
arises because NEURON's surface-density gbar scales total channel current by d while axial
load scales by d^2, cancelling the net effect. If density rescaling produces a non-flat DSI
trend, the compensation confound is confirmed; if still flat, rule out this hypothesis.

Peak firing rate is 5.15 Hz in t0024 versus the paper's qualitative ~30-40 Hz and the t0004
envelope of 40-80 Hz. The paper text and the companion repository disagree on Ra, eleak, and

Another rescue candidate: M-current is a slowly-activating, non-inactivating K+ current with
V_half around -40 to -45 mV. Unlike Kv3 it doesn't repolarise fast APs; it provides a tonic
outward current that opposes sustained depolarisation. In a Nav1.6-driven high-firing regime,
M-current would provide steady hyperpolarisation that reduces the cell's mean depolarisation,
possibly restoring the regime where the GABA shunt has more leverage. Implementation: write a
simple m^1 MOD with V_half = -45 mV, tau ~50 ms, sweep at Nav1.6_med + Nav1.6_high.

The answer asset identifies the cortical-style Ca2+-plateau initiation zone (Larkum 1999) as a
plausible but uncertain motif for DSGCs (caveat: DSGC dendritic trees lack the tuft / basal
two-compartment layout of cortical pyramidals). Build a compartmental DSGC model with
spatially-varying L-type / T-type Ca2+-channel densities to identify candidate initiation-zone
compartments, then test whether asymmetric inhibition at principal-branch bifurcations can
selectively enable Ca2+ plateaus during preferred-direction motion and suppress them during
null-direction motion. Report preferred-direction burst firing rate versus null-direction
burst rate and compare with published DSGC spiking statistics.

t0039 shows the t0022 discriminator's total DSI spread across a 4x diameter range is only
0.061 (0.368 to 0.429). Any pure-morphology optimiser running at GABA=4 nS on t0022 has a
ceiling of 0.429 (the 4 nS saturation value). If t0033's planned optimiser is scoped to
maximise DSI via morphology alone, the maximum achievable lift from the baseline is ~0.06 -
the headroom is much smaller than originally planned. Consider adding a channel-density
dimension to the optimiser search space, since DSI has more potential room through Nav/Cav
density than through morphology alone.

The t0022 testbed currently has no Ih (HCN) channels in DEND_CHANNELS. Literature prior from
t0019 (voltage-gated-channels survey) flags Ih as a common dendritic modulator: it lowers
input resistance and shortens the E-I temporal window over which coincidence matters. Add Ih
at a realistic dendritic density (e.g., 1e-5 S/cm^2 following hippocampal CA1 values as a
start) to the DEND_CHANNELS forsec block and rerun the canonical 12-angle x 10-trial sweep
plus an EI_OFFSET sweep in {5, 10, 15, 20, 30} ms. Expected outcome: the E-I integration
window narrows (only tight E-I offsets produce DSI, long offsets stop working), quantifying
the dendritic-integration timescale imposed by Ih. Dependencies: t0022 library asset,
S-0022-03 infrastructure for EI offset sweeps if already done. Effort ~10 hours. Recommended

arf/scripts/verificators/ check that any DSGC task using NMDA_MgBlock can invoke as a

and asserts the monotonicity + threshold pattern within tolerance. Companion to S-0054-04

Model t0022 peak firing collapses from 129 Hz at V=-30 to 26 Hz at V=-20 due to Na
inactivation, but t0024 still rises monotonically to 7.6 Hz at V=-20 with no collapse.
Extending the t0024 sweep to V_rest >= -20 mV would reveal whether t0024 also exhibits a
Na-inactivation collapse (suggesting shared mechanism at higher depolarisations) or remains
depolarisation-insensitive (suggesting NMDA-dominated signalling).

Persistent sodium currents are dysregulated in several pathologies: epilepsy (SCN1A
gain-of-function increases NaP), motor neuron disease (NaP downregulation in ALS), and chronic
pain (NaP upregulation in DRG neurons). Survey the literature for clinical/preclinical reports
of altered NaP in retinal pathologies or DSGCs specifically. If found, this t0067 finding

NaP at high density on the AIS gave the largest signal (-0.78 ΔDSI), 80% of the soma version's
effect. Persistent Na is interesting because it survives the AIS+axon's electrical sink — its
non-inactivating depolarisation accumulates over the trial duration, so even a small AIS can
pump enough current. Question: does the AIS NaP effect scale predictably with AIS geometry, or
does it saturate? Test NaP at {1.0, 1.5, 2.4, 3.5, 5.0} mS/cm² on AIS at fixed (L=30 μm,
diam=1 μm); also test 2.4 mS/cm² at diam ∈ {0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5} μm. Hypothesis: NaP gnabar ×
AIS surface area ≈ constant for a fixed DSI effect (i.e., the cell sees the integrated NaP
current). 9 conditions × 2 directions × 5 seeds = 90 trials, ~5 min.

t0067 sweep showed Kv3 alone (without Nav1.6) had essentially no effect on firing rate or DSI
(DSI = 0.80 → 0.82 across low/med/high). t0068 shows Kv3 also has no rescue effect on top of
Nav1.6. To confirm that this isn't a model artefact (e.g., Kv3 not engaging because of an MOD
bug), run a finer Kv3-only sweep with very high densities (60, 200, 500 mS/cm^2) and check
whether SOME density level produces a measurable firing-rate effect. If Kv3 at 500 mS/cm^2
still does nothing, our simplified Kv3 MOD likely needs revision to a richer kinetic scheme
(e.g., Wang-Buzsaki with two-component decay).

Inserting cad on the soma shifted Bed A's baseline DSI from 0.7975 (no-cad regression) to
0.308 legacy / 0.193 vector-sum (with-cad). This shift is a structural artefact of soma-only
Ca-pool insertion. Real DSGCs have distributed Ca channels and Ca pools throughout the
dendrites. Test: insert cad on the dendritic compartments (not the soma), then re-run a small
validation sweep (baseline + 3 BK densities × 12 angles × 5 seeds = 240 trials). Hypothesis:
dendritic cad insertion preserves the no-cad baseline DSI more closely while still providing
functional Ca for BK / SK channels in the dendrites. If confirmed, this is the right substrate
design for t0075 active-dendrite work and improves t0074's biological plausibility post-hoc.

measured 17.3x for mouse alpha-ON-sustained RGCs and a conservative interpretation of Werginz
2020's RGC ratio (~7x for mouse OFF-alpha-T RGCs, in metadata only because the PDF is
paywalled). Tighten the floor to >=7 to match the Werginz 2020 point estimate and re-run
NSGA-II at the same pop=24 / gen=8 budget. The hypothesis is that the >=5 floor still permits

simulations on a single soma in NEURON for each MOD (step protocol from -90 to +40 mV in 10 mV
steps, 100 ms duration) and compare resulting current traces against Pfeiffer-Friedrich 2012

deviate by > 20%, retune the MOD parameters or vendor an RGC-specific MOD instead. Cost: ~1

The deposited Poleg-Polsky cell has no axon initial segment (AIS). Real RGCs concentrate
Nav1.6 / Kv1 at the AIS at ~50× somatic densities (per t0019 priors: 2500-5000 pS/μm² for
Nav1.6 at distal AIS). Putting these channels on the soma in t0067 is a simplification that
almost certainly understates their effect on AP initiation timing and shape. Add a 30 μm AIS
section between soma and a virtual axon (1 mm passive cable) to the build_dsgc, then re-run
the t0067 channel sweep with insertion on the AIS instead of the soma. Expected: same channels
show much larger DSI effects (because the AIS, being smaller and electrically isolated, is
more sensitive to gnabar additions). Cost: ~1 hour code + ~10 min compute.

Bundled follow-up to the t0078 architectural diagnostic. The 49-d MOBO grazed the joint pass
(iter 81: DSI 0.316 / PD 9.68 Hz) but the high-DSI rail's PD ceiling held at 2.86 Hz across
109 acquisitions: passive dendrites are the bottleneck. Add: (a) Mg-block NMDA at active
densities on dendrites; (b) Nav1.6 / NaP at distal-dendrite densities sufficient for
back-propagating APs and dendritic spikes (Sivyer 2013, Oesch 2005). Hard lower-bound AIS Nav
at 0.25 S/cm^2 (Kole 2008 prior) so the optimiser cannot exploit the AIS-disabled corner (iter
81 nav16_ais 1e-5, four orders below prior). Use NSGA-II via pymoo (pop 64-128, 30-50 gens,
64-core CPU) not BoTorch qLogNEHVI to avoid O(N^3) GP-fit scaling that pushed t0078 to $3.93

t0052 is AMPA-only by design; PolegPolsky2016 attributes ~35% of PD PSP magnitude to NMDA (5.8
mV / 16.5 mV total) and shows NMDARs contribute multiplicatively at depolarised potentials.
Add a NEURON Exp2Syn-based NMDA component (rise 5 ms, decay 50 ms, e=0, Mg-block via
voltage-dependent gating or a simplified gating function) co-located with each AMPA synapse,
and sweep gNMDA in {0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5} nS at the t0052 baseline (100 E + 100 I,
gAMPA = 0.5 nS, scalar gabaMOD). Report peak Hz, primary and vector-sum DSI, HWHM, and PD/ND
PSP magnitudes per gNMDA. Goal: test whether NMDA addition closes the peak-rate gap toward the
t0004 30 Hz target without breaking the DSI = 1.0 design from gabaMOD, in a
minimal-from-scratch substrate (not the deposited 189347 paper-port substrate of t0046-t0049).

Cell 767 crosses the joint pass threshold (DSI 0.494 / PD 11.39 Hz) but the biophysical
mechanism is unattributed: it could be NMDA Mg-block recruitment, distal Nav1.6 dendritic
spikes, persistent Na (NaP) sustained depolarisation, or a combination. Generate per-direction

t0069 falsified S-0067-03 because the AIS+axon couldn't dominate spike initiation against the
deposited cell's 400 mS/cm² somatic gnabar_HHst. The natural fix: reduce somatic gnabar to 200
mS/cm² (or 100), re-attach the same AIS+axon, and re-run the t0069 sweep. Hypothesis: with a
weakened soma, the AIS becomes the dominant spike-initiation zone and AIS-localised Nav1.6 /
NaP / NaR / Kv3 / Kv4 show ≥2× larger |ΔDSI| than at the unweakened-soma baseline.
Implementation is a 1-line patch to apply_params (or a new HOC override) plus the existing
t0069 sweep code; ~10 min compute. This is the prerequisite for any meaningful AIS channel
test on this cell.

The answer asset nav-kv-combinations-for-dsgc-modelling produces a 6-point specification for
DSGC voltage-gated-channel distribution in NEURON extending the synaptic-integration
constraints from t0018. The downstream DSGC compartmental-model build task must implement: (1)
Nav1.6 with V_half around -45 mV and fast kinetics at distal AIS (densities 2500-5000 pS/um2),
(2) Nav1.2 with V_half around -32 mV at proximal AIS and soma (lower density around 100-500
pS/um2), (3) Kv1.1/Kv1.2 delayed-rectifier with V_half -40 to -50 mV at AIS (density 100-500
pS/um2), (4) Fohlmeister-Miller HH rate functions with Q10 near 3 for temperature scaling (all
mechanisms tested at 22 and 32 degC), (5) passive soma/dendrite compartments with no Nav
except for low-density Nav1.2 co-expression on proximal dendrites, (6) named fitting
objectives for AP threshold (AIS initiation at -55 mV +/- 5 mV), AP width (0.5-1.0 ms at 32
degC), and backpropagation attenuation (50% by 100 um into dendrite) to reproduce
Fohlmeister-Miller RGC firing properties.

Schachter2010 reports that switching DSGC dendrites from passive to active (adding
Fohlmeister-like g_Na and g_K) raises DSI from ~0.3 to ~0.7 on the same morphology and
synaptic input, and Oesch2005 provides the TTX-sensitive dendritic Na+ spike patch-clamp data
that anchor this claim. Run two paired simulations that differ only in dendritic g_Na (0 vs
Schachter2010 density), holding morphology, synapse placement, and stimulus identical, and
report the DSI delta with 95% CI across synapse-placement seeds. This directly answers RQ4 and
isolates the dendritic-conductance contribution from morphology and synaptic effects.

t0076 demonstrated the bare 25-d Bed B substrate cannot reach DSI>=0.4 AND PD rate>=30 Hz
simultaneously. Compare-literature concluded the substrate is missing dendritic-spike
machinery and there is no AIS. After S-0024-03 (add AIS to Bed B as a library asset) is
delivered, re-run the t0076 25-d MOBO on the AIS-equipped Bed B with 2 extra channel-density
parameters for the AIS tier (Nav1.6_AIS, Kv3_AIS) -> 27-d search. Hypothesis: AIS-localised
spike initiation will let high-Nav cells reach physiological rates without quenching DSI. This
complements t0075 (AIS sweep on Bed A) by porting the question to the second substrate under
joint optimisation rather than one-axis-at-a-time. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

t0047 confirms DSI vs gNMDA peaks at 0.19 near b2gnmda = 0.5 nS and decays to 0.018 by 3.0 nS,
never reaching the paper's claimed flat ~0.30. Most plausible source: the deposited control's
`Voff_bipNMDA = 0` (voltage-dependent NMDA with Mg block). As gNMDA rises, ND dendrites
depolarise enough to relieve Mg block and ND NMDA catches up to PD, collapsing DSI. The
paper's biological NMDA is voltage-INDEPENDENT. Direct test: re-execute the same 7-point sweep
(PD/ND, 4+ trials) at `exptype = 2` (sets `Voff_bipNMDA = 1`, the same setting used by 0Mg)
instead of `exptype = 1`. Expected: DSI flattens toward ~0.20-0.30 across the sweep. Not a
model modification — only an exptype choice. Re-uses t0046 library and t0047's

t0068 falsified the Nav1.6 + Kv3 rescue hypothesis: Kv3 doesn't differentially suppress firing
at high rates because its activation depends on V, not on cumulative Ca2+. The natural
alternative is a Ca2+-activated K+ channel (BK / KCa1.1 or SK / KCa2). These channels' open
probability scales with intracellular [Ca2+], which itself scales with cumulative AP firing.
Therefore: ND (low firing, low [Ca2+]) → BK/SK barely active → cell fires normally. PD (high
firing, high [Ca2+]) → BK/SK strongly activated → cell is clamped down → PD firing reduced
more than ND firing → DSI restored. This is mechanistically coherent and biologically
plausible (DSGCs express both BK and SK in vivo). Implementation: vendor a BK MOD (e.g., from
Hines & Carnevale's Purkinje model) AND a Ca2+ pool mechanism, then sweep BK density at fixed
Nav1.6 = high. Cost: 1-2 hours code + ~5 min compute per density.

t0067 tested each channel in isolation. Real fast-spiking neurons co-express Nav1.6 (fast-Na
with low threshold) AND Kv3 (fast K+ for rapid repolarisation) — the joint expression enables
sustained 100+ Hz firing without fatigue. Test co-insertion: 4 conditions on the t0065
substrate ({Nav1.6_med, Nav1.6_med + Kv3_med, Nav1.6_high, Nav1.6_high + Kv3_high}) × PD/ND ×
5 seeds = 40 trials. Hypothesis: Kv3 co-insertion will RESCUE DSI by allowing the cell to
recover from Nav1.6's depolarising drive faster, restoring the inhibitory shunt's modulatory
power. If true, this is a proof-of-concept that biological 'fast-spiking design' is
intrinsically DS-friendly.
