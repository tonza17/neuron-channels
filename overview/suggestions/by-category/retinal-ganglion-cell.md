<summary>🧪 <strong>Factorial morphology sweep (branch orders, segment length,
segment diameter) at fixed synapse count</strong> (S-0002-04)</summary>

ElQuessny2021 concludes that global DSGC morphology has only a minor effect on the synaptic
E/I distribution, but the survey finds no paper that runs a clean factorial sweep over the
three local-electrotonic knobs separately. With synaptic count fixed at the PolegPolsky
177+177 baseline and dendrites set to active (Schachter2010 densities), vary (number of branch
orders, mean segment length, mean segment diameter) on an orthogonal grid, record DSI and HWHM
per point, and test whether segment diameter has the largest effect (as cable theory
predicts). This directly answers RQ2 and provides the morphology-sensitivity map the project
currently lacks. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

<summary>📚 <strong>Port the Poleg-Polsky & Diamond 2016 DSGC ModelDB 189347 into

Download ModelDB 189347 (the only public DSGC NEURON model), re-run its included demo, and
register the resulting Python package as a library asset under `assets/library/`. This makes
the DSGC reference implementation available to every downstream simulation task without
re-download.

<summary>🧪 <strong>Benchmark NEURON vs Arbor on the project's actual DSGC
morphology</strong> (S-0003-03)</summary>

| Field | Value |

| **Categories** | [`compartmental-modeling`](../../../meta/categories/compartmental-modeling/), [`retinal-ganglion-cell`](../../../meta/categories/retinal-ganglion-cell/) |

Once a DSGC model runs in NEURON (via S-0003-02), port the same morphology and channel set to
Arbor 0.12.0 and measure single-cell simulation wall-clock on the project's workstation.
Third-party benchmarks claim Arbor is 7-12x faster; this task validates that claim on our
actual use case and records the real cost of the NMODL `modcc` translation that t0003 flagged
as the main Arbor adoption risk.

<summary>📚 <strong>Build a reusable SWC -> NEURON/NetPyNE/Arbor section-translator
library for dsgc-baseline-morphology</strong> (S-0005-04)</summary>

| Field | Value |

| **ID** | `S-0005-04` |

| **Source paper** | — |
| **Categories** | [`compartmental-modeling`](../../../meta/categories/compartmental-modeling/), [`retinal-ganglion-cell`](../../../meta/categories/retinal-ganglion-cell/) |

Every downstream compartmental-modelling task in this project will need to load the
dsgc-baseline-morphology SWC into a simulator and produce a section/segment graph indexed by
SWC compartment id, soma reference, and per-section parent links. NEURON's built-in Import3d
handling of CNG SWCs is fragile (soma-3point convention, branch-point splitting, axon stubs)
and other simulators have their own quirks (NetPyNE's netParams.cellParams, Arbor's morphology
builder). Write a small library asset that exposes a pure-function
load_dsgc_morphology(simulator: str) -> SimulatorMorphology API with verified-equivalent
loaders for NEURON, NetPyNE, and Arbor, plus a smoke test that compares total path length and
compartment count across loaders against validate_swc.py. This eliminates per-task SWC-loading
bugs and keeps morphology choice swappable when S-0005-03 lands. Recommended task types:
write-library.

<summary>📂 <strong>Download additional Feller-archive DSGC reconstructions to enable
cross-cell variability sensitivity analysis</strong> (S-0005-03)</summary>

The current dsgc-baseline-morphology commits the project to a single reconstructed cell
(141009_Pair1DSGC). Cell-to-cell variability in branching pattern, total path length, and
arbor extent is a known source of variance in DSGC tuning curves (RQ2), and the Feller archive
on NeuroMorpho hosts several sibling ON-OFF DSGC reconstructions from the same lab (e.g.,
141009_Pair2DSGC and other 2014 Pair* records). Download 3-5 additional Feller-archive ON-OFF
DSGC SWCs as separate dataset assets (each with its own NeuroMorpho neuron_id and provenance),
validate each with the existing validate_swc.py parser, and tabulate per-cell compartment
count, branch points, and total dendritic path length so a downstream morphology-sweep task
can quantify cross-cell variability without committing a priori to a specific morphology.
Recommended task types: download-dataset.

<summary>📊 <strong>Render and QA-check 2D/3D visualisations of
dsgc-baseline-morphology for documentation and synapse placement</strong>
(S-0005-05)</summary>

The dsgc-baseline-morphology asset is currently described only by tabulated statistics (6,736
compartments, 129 branch points, 1,536.25 um path length). Downstream tasks that place
AMPA/GABA synapses by spatial rule (e.g., Park2014 3-5x null/preferred IPSC asymmetry,
S-0002-05 GABA/AMPA density scan) need a visual reference for the dendritic arbor,
branch-order map, and soma orientation; reviewers also need a figure for any project paper.
Render three QA visualisations (2D top-down dendrogram coloured by Strahler order, 2D xy
projection coloured by path distance from soma, 3D rotating xyz scatter) using neurom +
matplotlib (or NEURON's PlotShape) and register the figures plus the rendering script as an
answer asset describing what was checked. Flag any visible reconstruction artefacts (dangling
branches, axon stubs, soma asymmetry) for downstream tasks. Recommended task types:
data-analysis, answer-question.

Park2014 (paper 10.1523_JNEUROSCI.5017-13.2014) and Chen2009 (paper
10.1113_jphysiol.2008.161240) are the two papers that set the mouse ON-OFF DSGC RQ5 targets
(DSI 0.6-0.9, peak 40-80 Hz, HWHM 60-90 deg). Park2014 is available open-access. Digitise the
published tuning-curve figure(s) into a reusable dataset asset (angle in degrees, spike rate
in Hz, error bars, cell counts) so the model can be scored against measured data rather than
only against the analytic target in t0004. This gives the project a literature-grounded
validation benchmark distinct from the canonical analytic target. Recommended task types:
download-dataset, data-analysis.

Every compartment in the downloaded CNG SWC carries the placeholder radius 0.125 um because
the original Simple Neurite Tracer reconstruction did not record diameters. Cable-theory
predicts segment diameter is the single most influential local-electrotonic knob (see
S-0002-04), so leaving the uniform placeholder in place will silently bias every downstream
biophysical simulation (axial resistance, attenuation, spike initiation threshold). Build a
diameter-calibration pipeline that applies a literature-derived order-dependent diameter taper
(e.g., Vaney/Sivyer/Taylor 2012 mouse ON-OFF DSGC profile, or the Poleg-Polsky 2016
distribution) keyed on Strahler order or path distance from the soma, write the calibrated SWC
as a new dataset asset (e.g., dsgc-baseline-morphology-calibrated), and report the per-order
diameter distribution against the original placeholder. Recommended task types:
feature-engineering, data-analysis.

The dsgc-baseline-morphology asset (NeuroMorpho neuron 102976, 141009_Pair1DSGC) currently has
source_paper_id=null because two Feller-lab papers from 2018 are plausibly the source: the
plan-nominated Morrie & Feller 2018 Neuron (DOI 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.05.028) and the
NeuroMorpho-reported Murphy-Baum & Feller 2018 Current Biology (DOI
10.1016/j.cub.2018.03.001). Run /add-paper for both DOIs in a dedicated download-paper task,
read each paper's Methods to confirm which one introduced the 141009_Pair1DSGC reconstruction,
then file a corrections asset that updates dsgc-baseline-morphology source_paper_id to the
correct paper_id slug. This unblocks correct citation of the morphology in every downstream
paper-comparison task. Recommended task types: download-paper.

Create a task that `uv pip install neuron==8.2.7 netpyne==1.1.1` into the project's
virtualenv, compiles the bundled Hodgkin-Huxley MOD files with `nrnivmodl`, runs a
1-compartment sanity simulation, and records the installed versions, install-time warnings,
and simulation wall-clock in a task asset. Rationale: the t0003 survey selected this toolchain
but did not install it; the next simulation task needs a validated environment.
