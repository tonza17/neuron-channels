## High Priority

<details>
<summary>🧪 <strong>Factorial morphology sweep (branch orders, segment length,
segment diameter) at fixed synapse count</strong> (S-0002-04)</summary>

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **ID** | `S-0002-04` |
| **Kind** | experiment |
| **Date added** | 2026-04-19 |
| **Source task** | [`t0002_literature_survey_dsgc_compartmental_models`](../../../overview/tasks/task_pages/t0002_literature_survey_dsgc_compartmental_models.md) |

ElQuessny2021 concludes that global DSGC morphology has only a minor effect on the synaptic
E/I distribution, but the survey finds no paper that runs a clean factorial sweep over the
three local-electrotonic knobs separately. With synaptic count fixed at the PolegPolsky
177+177 baseline and dendrites set to active (Schachter2010 densities), vary (number of branch
orders, mean segment length, mean segment diameter) on an orthogonal grid, record DSI and HWHM
per point, and test whether segment diameter has the largest effect (as cable theory
predicts). This directly answers RQ2 and provides the morphology-sensitivity map the project
currently lacks. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

## Medium Priority

<summary>📂 <strong>Reproduce the Park2014 mouse ON-OFF DSGC tuning-curve dataset
as a validation benchmark</strong> (S-0002-10)</summary>

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **ID** | `S-0002-10` |
| **Kind** | dataset |
| **Date added** | 2026-04-19 |
| **Source task** | [`t0002_literature_survey_dsgc_compartmental_models`](../../../overview/tasks/task_pages/t0002_literature_survey_dsgc_compartmental_models.md) |
| **Source paper** | [`10.1523_JNEUROSCI.5017-13.2014`](../../../tasks/t0002_literature_survey_dsgc_compartmental_models/assets/paper/10.1523_JNEUROSCI.5017-13.2014/) |

Park2014 (paper 10.1523_JNEUROSCI.5017-13.2014) and Chen2009 (paper
10.1113_jphysiol.2008.161240) are the two papers that set the mouse ON-OFF DSGC RQ5 targets
(DSI 0.6-0.9, peak 40-80 Hz, HWHM 60-90 deg). Park2014 is available open-access. Digitise the
published tuning-curve figure(s) into a reusable dataset asset (angle in degrees, spike rate
in Hz, error bars, cell counts) so the model can be scored against measured data rather than
only against the analytic target in t0004. This gives the project a literature-grounded
validation benchmark distinct from the canonical analytic target. Recommended task types:
download-dataset, data-analysis.
