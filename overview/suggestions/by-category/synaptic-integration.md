t0057 confirmed (alongside t0052, t0053, t0054) that AMPA = 0.5 nS x 100 synapses gives at
most one spike per trial; this binary regime cannot produce graded DSI under any inhibition
mechanism. S-0052-01 proposes the AMPA escape on the t0052 scalar-gabaMOD substrate; this
suggestion proposes the matching experiment on the t0057 tonic substrate so the AMPA-escape
and tonic-GABA-amplitude axes are directly cross-comparable. Sweep AMPA per-synapse
conductance in {0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0} nS at fixed GABA_BASE_NS in {0.5, 1.0, 1.5}
nS (21 grid cells, 7560 trials). Report peak Hz, FULL-mode primary and vector-sum DSI, HWHM,
and reliability per cell. Pass criterion: locate at least one (gAMPA, gGABA) point on the
tonic substrate with peak Hz in 5-50 Hz AND vector-sum DSI > 0.3, or rule out such a point in
the sustained-envelope regime. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

t0052 hits primary DSI 1.0 but peak rate is only 0.667 Hz, ~22x below the t0004 target (30 Hz)
and 30-150x below the in vivo / in vitro DSGC range (30-100 Hz, Park2014 / PolegPolsky2016).
The current AMPA conductance is 0.5 nS x 100 synapses (AMPA-only by design) and the cell is
locked in a single-spike-per-trial regime that makes DSI = 1.0 trivially. Sweep the
per-synapse AMPA peak conductance over {0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0} nS at fixed synapse
count and gabaMOD design, re-run the 12-direction x 10-trial FULL sweep, and report peak Hz,
vector-sum DSI, HWHM, and reliability per gAMPA. Goal: locate the gAMPA where peak rate enters
the 30-100 Hz band and the cell leaves the binary on/off regime, so DSI dynamics become
biologically informative. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

t0065 ran the protocol on deposited Poleg-Polsky; t0066 ran it on de Rosenroll. Both showed
flat IPSP_PASSIVE because of e_GABA = v_rest design. The from-scratch family (t0052-t0059) is
trapped in a binary regime (single-spike-trivial-DSI or full-suppression-zero-DSI). A direct
EPSP_PASSIVE / IPSP_PASSIVE / FULL decomposition on the from-scratch substrate would tell us
whether (a) the from-scratch family also has e_GABA = v_rest (if so, the binary regime is from
a different cause), or (b) the from-scratch family uses e_GABA != v_rest (in which case the
IPSP would be hyperpolarising and could explain the binary trap). The same protocol code is
portable: copy run_protocol.py, swap the cell builder import, adjust HH knob names. Cost: ~1
hour code + ~30 min sweep (the from-scratch family is faster — fewer trials needed because
lower noise variance). This is the natural successor to S-0065-01, now made more urgent by the
t0066 findings.

t0065 isolated the deposited cell's EPSP and IPSP shapes and showed that direction selectivity
in that cell comes from differential shunting inhibition (e_SACinhib = v_rest = -60 mV, so
opening Cl- channels produces zero net Vm deflection). The from-scratch family (t0052-t0059)
is trapped in a binary regime: single-spike-per-trial trivial DSI = 1, or full suppression DSI
= 0. A direct EPSP_PASSIVE / IPSP_PASSIVE / FULL decomposition on the from-scratch substrate
(using t0057's library wiring: 100 E + 100 I synapses on t0009 morphology) would tell us
whether the binary-regime failure is excitatory under-drive, hyperpolarising rather than
shunting inhibition, or HH miscalibration. The same six-trial protocol from tasks/t0065_*/code
can be ported to the from-scratch cell builder with minimal changes. Expected output: six
traces showing whether the from-scratch IPSP is hyperpolarising (would localise the
binary-regime cause) or flat-at-reversal (would invalidate the shunting hypothesis).

<summary>🧪 <strong>GABA-reduction ladder on Mg-block t0055 architecture to find a
DSI-preserving operating point with peak Hz >= 5</strong> (S-0055-03)</summary>

t0055 established that Mg-block NMDA recovers DSI to 0.7464 but the cell stays at 0.667 Hz
peak in FULL mode because the scalar gabaMOD inhibition (peak 2 nS, gaba_mod_PD = 0.33,
gaba_mod_ND = 0.99) clamps Vm below the Mg-unblock voltage. Sweep peak GABA conductance at
{2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3} nS at gNMDA = 0.5 nS (mid-sweep) and trace DSI and peak Hz. The
S-0054-01 pass criterion (DSI > 0.50 AND peak Hz >= 5 Hz) should become reachable somewhere on
this ladder. This is a tighter, faster, and conceptually cleaner experiment than the full
S-0054-02 3D sweep, and it directly answers the t0055 finding. Pass criterion: at least one
GABA value yields DSI > 0.50 AND peak Hz >= 5 Hz. Recommended task type: experiment-run.

<summary>🧪 <strong>GABA-synapse-count sweep on t0052 to characterise driving-force
saturation of scalar gabaMOD IPSPs</strong> (S-0052-02)</summary>

The headline secondary finding of t0052 is that the somatic IPSP voltage ratio (1.54x)
substantially under-predicts the gabaMOD conductance ratio (3.0x) because driving force (V -
E_GABA) saturates as ~100 GABA synapses fire near-synchronously and local Vm approaches E_GABA
= -75 mV. Characterise this saturation curve by sweeping the number of GABA synapses N_I in
{10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300} at fixed per-synapse peak (2 nS) and fixed gabaMOD(theta)
design, holding 100 AMPA synapses constant. Report somatic IPSP voltage ratio (gNULL_voltage /
gPD_voltage), peak / null PSP magnitudes, primary and vector-sum DSI, and peak Hz per N_I.
Goal: produce a quantitative voltage-vs-conductance saturation curve that future
scalar-gabaMOD models can use to translate nominal conductance ratios into expected somatic
suppression. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

The t0070 writeup shows Bed A (t0008) and Bed B (t0024) encode PD vs ND by fundamentally
different mechanisms. Bed A keeps bar geometry fixed and swaps a presynaptic envelope scalar
`gabaMOD = 0.33` (PD) / `0.99` (ND) applied uniformly to every SACinhib synapse. Bed B keeps
conductances fixed and rotates the bar direction (0 deg / 180 deg), simultaneously shifting
per-synapse arrival times AND changing a sigmoidal release probability `p_rel ~= 0.05` (PD) /
`0.80` (ND) plus AR(2) noise. Any cross-bed comparison (t0065 vs t0066, or future Bed B ports
of t0067/t0068/t0069) is therefore confounded. Pick one canonical encoding (recommended:
spatial bar rotation, biophysically grounded) and either (a) port it to Bed A by replacing the
gabaMOD scalar with per-synapse spatial gating (extending S-0050-01), or (b) define a shared
effective-inhibition-strength calibration curve. Recommended task types: experiment-run,
comparative-analysis.

The answer asset synaptic-integration-priors-for-dsgc-modelling produces a 6-point
specification for DSGC synaptic integration in NEURON extending the space-clamp/AIS/NMDAR
constraints from t0017. The downstream DSGC compartmental-model build task must implement: (1)
AMPA with dual-exponential kinetics (tau_rise 0.2-0.4 ms, tau_decay 1-3 ms) and NMDA with
Mg2+-block + tau_decay 100-200 ms at 32 degC on glutamatergic inputs, (2) GABA_A with shunting
(reversal near resting Vm) and tau_decay 5-20 ms on SAC inputs, (3) E->I temporal lag of 15-50
ms on preferred-direction stimuli reproducing Wehr & Zador 2003 co-tuning, (4) asymmetric
GABAergic inputs that are strong on null-side dendrites (to match Euler-Detwiler-Denk 2002 SAC
Ca2+ DS index 0.3-0.5) and weak on preferred-side dendrites, (5) dendritic-location-dependent
EPSP attenuation consistent with Hausser-Mel lambda_DC 100-300 um, (6) named fitting
objectives for DSI under shunting-inhibition block (should drop toward 0) and EPSP/IPSP charge
balance during null-direction motion.

t0054 fixed AMPA at 0.5 nS and used the unchanged t0052 scalar gabaMOD (2 nS base, ratio 3.0),
varying only gNMDA. The DSI collapse may be recoverable by rebalancing the three conductances
jointly. Run a 3-D grid: gAMPA in {0.25, 0.5, 1.0} nS, gNMDA in {0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5} nS, base
gGABA in {2, 4, 8, 16} nS, all on the t0054 codebase with placement seed 0 unchanged,
voltage-independent NMDA kept (so this is the no-Mg-block control complementary to S-0054-01).
Use 12 dirs x 5 trials per cell = 60 trials per (gAMPA, gNMDA, gGABA) point; 48 grid cells =
2880 trials. Apply early stop on cells where E_ONLY peak Hz > 30 Hz to prune the saturated
subgrid. Pass criterion: locate at least one (gAMPA, gNMDA, gGABA) triple with vector-sum DSI
>= 0.5 and peak Hz in 10-50 Hz, or rule out such an operating point in the voltage-independent
regime. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

The deposited cell places e_SACinhib = -60 mV which equals the cell's leak-driven quiescent
potential, making inhibition purely shunting. If the from-scratch family uses an e_GABA below
resting potential (e.g., -75 mV which is biologically plausible for Cl- with low [Cl-]_i),
inhibition becomes hyperpolarising and can collapse the DSI to 0 by pulling the cell off
threshold across all directions. Conversely, if e_GABA > v_rest, inhibition can depolarise
toward threshold and generate spurious spikes. Setting e_GABA = v_rest in the from-scratch
substrate is a single-line change (modify the gaba_tonic.mod e parameter or the synapse
mechanism's reversal). This directly tests whether the deposited cell's success is
structurally dependent on its e_GABA = v_rest design choice. Expected output: from-scratch
family with e_GABA = v_rest produces a graded tuning curve with 5-15 Hz peak in PD and DSI in
[0.5, 0.85], matching the deposited cell's behaviour.

S-0057-06 covers Mg-block NMDA + tonic GABA but uses t0057's global (100, 1400) ms tonic
window and fixed gAMPA = 0.5 nS. t0059 demonstrates the bar-locked window mechanism delivers
an 8.5 ms direction-dependent IPSP centre-of-mass shift (REQ-13 PASS) the global window

per-synapse bar-arrival timing (deRosenroll2026), and AMPA escape. Fork

Refactor the minimal-DSGC trial code (forked across t0052/t0053/t0054/t0055) to replace the
legacy FULL/E_ONLY/GABA_ONLY trio with a FULL/EPSP_PASSIVE/IPSP_PASSIVE trio. EPSP_PASSIVE and
IPSP_PASSIVE must save-and-zero soma+AIS gnabar_hh and gkbar_hh so the recorded EPSP and IPSP
traces are clean synaptic envelopes, not spike-contaminated traces (the user-flagged bug that
made t0054 REQ-20 and t0055 REQ-20 return null at every gNMDA). Drop the per-synapse
activation-time histogram. Confirm and standardize the trial length with the user (1400 vs
1500 ms vs longer window for EPSP-decay metrics; 3000-5000 ms recommended by S-0054-03). Pass
criterion: EPSP/IPSP traces from a representative gNMDA value show no Na+ spikes; HH-on FULL
trace is unchanged within 1e-6 mV vs current code. Recommended task types: write-library,
infrastructure-setup. This is a project-wide infrastructure fix that benefits every future

Cumulative project evidence (t0054, t0055, t0057) converges on PolegPolsky2016's argument that

but kept scalar gabaMOD inhibition; t0057 swapped inhibition to tonic but kept AMPA-only
excitation. Neither tested the combination. Build a minimal architecture combining (a) AMPA +
Jahr-Stevens Mg-block NMDA (t0055 NMDA_MgBlock.mod) on each E synapse and (b) tonic GABA via
gaba_tonic.mod (t0057) with the t0053 spatial centripetal gating predicate on each I synapse.

The t0022 driver schedules GABA directly onto each DSGC dendrite, skipping the SAC (Starburst
Amacrine Cell) layer that shapes DS inhibition in vivo (Euler-Detwiler-Denk 2002). Extend the
modeldb_189347_dsgc_dendritic library with a configurable SAC layer: an array of simplified
SAC models (single-compartment or 2-compartment) whose dendritic output drives DSGC GABA
synapses via NetCon, with SAC dendrites themselves direction-tuned per Euler2002. Expected
outcome: DSI becomes graded rather than saturated (real SAC output is not a hard half-plane
step) and peak firing rate may rise because SAC inhibition is timed to bar arrival not to a
global half-plane rule. This is a library extension not just a channel swap; produces a fourth
DSGC library asset modeldb_189347_dsgc_sac. Dependencies: t0022 library asset, Euler2002

Author a new MOD mechanism (or extend `bipolarNMDA.mod`) that selectively blocks NMDAR
conductance in dendritic compartments while leaving somatic NMDAR + AMPA intact, mirroring the
paper's intracellular MK801 (iMK801) protocol. The current AP5 analogue used in t0046
(`b2gnmda = 0`) removes ALL NMDAR contribution and silences the cell entirely (DSI = 0 under
AP5); the paper's iMK801 leaves PD spiking, allowing the qualitative 'DSI preserved under AP5'
Fig 8 claim to be reproduced. This unblocks a faithful Fig 8 AP5 reproduction and resolves the
AP5-vs-iMK801 mechanistic divergence catalogued as discrepancy 1 of 12 in t0046's audit.

the AMPA conductance scaled across {1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125} of the deposited b2gampa = 0.25 nS
value. t0048's per-class conductance comparison shows AMPA summed conductance is similar
between PD/ND (~11 nS each), so AMPA changes alone cannot create direction selectivity, but
lowering AMPA at fixed GABA could shift the AMPA/GABA balance enough to amplify whatever
residual selectivity GABA provides. This is an essential negative control for S-0048-01: if
AMPA reduction matches GABA reduction in DSI effect, the gap is symmetric and not purely GABA.

The bit-identical DSI = 0.7464 across all gNMDA values in t0055 FULL mode is mechanistically
explained by a single inequality: peak EPSP Vm under inhibition < Mg-unblock voltage (~-40 to
-20 mV). Derive a closed-form (or numeric) prediction from a single-compartment cable-theory
model: given AMPA peak conductance gAMPA, GABA peak conductance gGABA, gabaMOD direction
modulation, and the Jahr-Stevens Boltzmann (n=0.25, gamma=0.08, Vset, e=-65), what (gAMPA,
gGABA) ratio places the preferred-direction peak Vm right at the unblock knee? Validate
against the t0055 numbers (gAMPA = 0.5 nS, gGABA = 2 nS x 0.33, peak Vm ~= -55 mV — below
knee, predicting NMDA does not contribute). The output is a 2D heat-map predicting the
operating point that S-0055-03 / S-0054-02 should target empirically. Pass criterion:
theoretical prediction matches the t0055 NMDA-inert regime within +/-5 mV at the preferred

Creative-thinking (alternative 5) proposed that AR(2)-correlated release with rho=0.6
temporally smooths the null-direction noise floor, potentially contributing to the observed
primary-DSI non-monotonicity independently of cable filtering. This hypothesis must be ruled
in or out before the cable-filtering interpretation is credible. Run the 12-direction x
10-trial protocol on t0024 at baseline morphology (length=1.0x, diameter=1.0x) with rho in
{0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9} (four points) and compare primary-DSI, vector-sum DSI, null Hz, and HWHM
trajectories. If DSI is flat across rho, stochastic-release smoothing is not the driver; if
DSI varies with rho, the effect is release-noise-mediated. Distinct from S-0026-02 (which
crosses rho with V_rest to disambiguate noise vs depolarisation) because this sweeps rho at
fixed V_rest and fixed morphology to isolate the release-noise-vs-cable-biophysics axis.

DSGC implementations independently use e_GABA = v_rest = -60 mV, producing pure shunting
inhibition. This is a recurring DSGC modelling pattern, not an idiosyncrasy. Conduct a
project-wide audit: read constants/parameter files for ALL DSGC ports (t0008, t0023 if
completed, the from-scratch family t0052-t0059) and record (V_INIT, ELEAK, GABA_EREV) tuples.
Map the design choice across ports. If any port uses e_GABA != v_rest, that becomes a useful

hyperpolarising. Output: a single answer asset summarising the audit with recommendations on

t0059 fixes window_ms = 200 (midpoint of the published 100-300 ms SAC->DSGC IPSC envelope

tau ~50-150 ms and deRosenroll2026 implies shorter envelopes match in vitro better. The 8.5 ms
IPSP centre-of-mass shift demonstrated at window_ms = 200 may sharpen substantially at
window_ms = 100 (more direction-tuned suppression) or smear out at window_ms = 500 (back

conductance-matched mean GABA mass: e.g., t0052 standard gabaMOD (66 nS) vs t0053 at 1.32 nS x
50 active = 66 nS, or matched at 100 nS. Use placement_seed0.json shared between tasks. Report

it is a pre-existing t0022 drive issue, not a diameter or GABA artefact. Duplicate of

below Schachter2010's 40-80 Hz baseline. The same low rate was observed in t0030 at 12 nS
GABA, so this is a pre-existing t0022 drive issue (likely the AMPA-only schedule lacking NMDA
or compensatory excitation), not a GABA ladder artefact. A task should add NMDA back into the
t0022 E-I schedule (or increase AMPA gain) and verify peak firing reaches 40+ Hz without

t0052 establishes that scalar gabaMOD models systematically over-promise somatic IPSP
suppression: the nominal conductance ratio 3.0x (gabaMOD(180)/gabaMOD(0)) produces only a
1.54x somatic IPSP voltage ratio under realistic 100-synapse crowding, because driving force
(V - E_GABA) saturates locally. Define and document a corrected `gabaMOD_eff(theta)` whose
conductance ratio is calibrated to produce the intended somatic-voltage IPSP modulation depth
(e.g., 3.0x somatic IPSP requires ~5-7x conductance ratio under crowding). Add a small library
helper that, given target voltage modulation depth and synapse count, returns the calibrated
gabaMOD curve via a one-time calibration run on the placement, and recommends using that curve
in downstream tasks (this would be applied via correction overlay or as a successor library
asset). Goal: future scalar-gabaMOD reports do not silently confuse conductance modulation

{baseline, +50%, +100%}, holding gabaMOD at the 0.33/0.99 PD/ND pair. Report the smallest
config shift that moves peak into [40, 80] Hz without dragging DSI outside [0.70, 0.85].
Distinct from S-0008-04 (sweeps all parameters including GABA side under the rotation-proxy
protocol); this is excitation-only under the native driver, addressable only now that t0020
localised the gap. Recommended task types: experiment-run, comparative-analysis.

The scaled-down 5-paper survey covers the five canonical themes (AMPA/NMDA/GABA kinetics,
shunting inhibition, E-I balance, dendritic-location integration, SAC-to-DSGC asymmetry) but
with one paper per theme, selected from the most-cited classical literature. A follow-up
survey task should add ~5 DSGC-targeted papers across: (a) modern DSGC-specific AMPA and NMDA
kinetic measurements at near-physiological temperature, (b) DSGC dynamic-clamp studies that
inject measured conductance waveforms, (c) connectomic reconstructions of SAC-to-DSGC wiring
(Briggman et al. 2011, Kim et al. 2014), (d) recent E-I temporal co-tuning studies in retina
(rather than auditory cortex), and (e) DSGC dendritic computation (Oesch, Euler, Taylor,
Sivyer). This closes the gap between canonical theory and DSGC-specific parameters.

t0036 introduced code/gaba_override.py which monkey-patches
_t0022_constants.GABA_CONDUCTANCE_NULL_NS at import time and re-binds the local name inside
trial_runner_diameter.py so the schedule_ei_onsets ratio is computed against the overridden
value. This pattern is immediately needed for S-0036-01 (further null-GABA reductions) and
S-0036-02 (GABA-AMPA timing offset). Rather than each task reimplementing the monkey-patch,
lift it into a library asset (working name: dsgc_t0022_schedule_overrides) exposing a typed
context-manager or setup function accepting gaba_null_ns, gaba_preferred_ns,
gaba_to_ampa_lead_ms, returning a provenance dict logged at task start. Ships a smoke test
asserting the override survived a fresh import and that the null/preferred ratio matches the
requested value. Distinct from S-0033-06 (DSI objective evaluator) which wraps the scoring
side - this wraps the schedule-parameter side. Recommended task types: write-library.

t0048 confirmed that switching to voltage-independent NMDA (exptype=2) flattens the DSI vs
gNMDA curve to 0.04-0.10 but never reaches the paper's claimed flat ~0.30. The residual gap
must come from non-NMDA mechanisms; the leading candidate is GABA, where t0047 measured
deposited PD ~106 / ND ~216 nS summed conductance vs paper's PD ~12.5 / ND ~30 nS (8x over) at
gNMDA = 0.5 nS. Run a parameter sweep at exptype=2 over a GABA scale factor in {1.0, 0.5,
0.25, 0.125, 0.06} (ratios chosen to bracket paper's 12.5x reduction toward biological values)
at the same 7 gNMDA grid points x 4 trials per direction used here. Track DSI vs (gNMDA, GABA
scale) and report whether any GABA setting produces flat DSI ~0.30 across the gNMDA range.
Pass criterion: identify a GABA scale (if any) that simultaneously satisfies the H1
range/slope thresholds and a mean-DSI > 0.20 target. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

`gabaMOD` (or per-synapse GABA) scan under SEClamp at gNMDA = 0.5 nS, exptype = control, with

introducing PD/ND spatial asymmetry (e.g., scale ND-side GABA up by 2-3x and PD-side GABA
down) to see whether the paper's ND-bias DSI -0.41 is recoverable by a spatial redistribution
at the soma. Distinct from S-0048-01 which scans GABA at exptype = 2 across a gNMDA sweep

t0036's creative_thinking cited 'timing dominates conductance' as the second-leading
explanation for why halving null-GABA from 12 nS to 6 nS did not unpin null firing: the t0022
schedule delivers GABA 10 ms BEFORE AMPA on null trials, and the integrated kinetic profile
(not the peak) may clamp the distal membrane below Nav threshold for the whole AMPA window.
Sweep the GABA-leads-AMPA offset across {10 ms (default), 5 ms, 0 ms, -5 ms (AMPA leads GABA)}
at two fixed GABA conductances (12 nS baseline and 6 nS) at diameter 1.0x only (12 angles x 10
trials x 4 offsets x 2 GABA = 960 trials, ~35 min CPU). Primary outcome: find the offset at
which null firing first exceeds 0.1 Hz, isolating timing as an independent rescue axis
orthogonal to S-0036-01's conductance axis. Distinct from S-0030-02 (Poisson) and S-0036-01

PolegPolsky2016 sets GABA/AMPA at 1:1 (177/177), while Park2014 and Taylor2002 constrain the
null/preferred IPSC ratio to 3-5x but not the total GABA density. Scan the GABA/AMPA density
ratio from 0.5 to 4.0 (keeping the 3-5x null asymmetry fixed, the 40-80 Hz preferred peak
fixed by the Na/K ridge, and the morphology and dendritic conductances fixed) and report how
tuning-curve HWHM and preferred peak rate co-vary. The expected pattern (sharper tuning at the
cost of lower peak rate) is stated in research_internet.md as hypothesis H4 but is not yet

t0052 scales all 100 I synapses by a graded gabaMOD(theta); t0053 binary-gates a subset at
full amplitude. A biologically motivated hybrid gates which I synapses fire (t0053's
per-synapse centripetal threshold) AND scales their amplitude by a global gabaMOD(theta)
factor (t0052's amplitude curve). This decomposition matches the SAC network's
centrifugal-release preference (spatial gating) layered on top of any global drive modulation.
Build a variant library `minimal_dsgc_hybrid_gaba` implementing both rules, sweep the gabaMOD
amplitude floor in {0.33, 0.5, 0.66, 1.0} at fixed centripetal threshold cos < 0, and report
DSI, peak Hz, HWHM, IPSP modulation, and active-fraction per floor. Goal: test whether
combining the two mechanisms produces a tuning curve closer to Park2014 / deRosenroll2026
bands than either alone. Recommended task types: build-model, experiment-run.

saturates at 1.0 across all 60 null-direction trials. Park2014, Oesch2005, and Poleg-Polsky &
Diamond 2016 all report DSI in the 0.5-0.8 range because real DSGCs have 2-5 Hz per-trial
spike jitter from stochastic bipolar release. Extend the driver with a configurable background
Poisson process (1, 2, 3, 5 Hz baseline rate on all synapses) and rerun the 12-angle x
10-trial sweep at each noise level. Expected outcome: DSI curve drops from 1.0 to ~0.8 at 2 Hz

Task_description Scope explicitly deferred intermediate values as follow-up work. Run 20
trials per condition at gabaMOD in {0.20, 0.33, 0.50, 0.66, 0.83, 0.99} and plot firing rate

Outputs: (1) a firing-rate-vs-gabaMOD curve that shows whether the 0.33 -> 0.99 transition is
sigmoidal, threshold-like, or linear; (2) the critical gabaMOD value at which DSI crosses 0.5

t0022 shows passive_filtering at 4 nS. Two explanations: (a) t0022 lacks active machinery, or
(b) 4 nS GABA shunts regenerative events that would otherwise produce Schachter2010
concave-down. A joint sweep GABA in {5, 4, 3, 2} x D in {0.5, 1.0, 2.0} = 12 conditions x 12
angles x 10 trials = 1440 trials (~60 min) would distinguish: if lower-GABA runs produce
concave-down curves, mechanism (b) is right; if all GABA levels show passive signatures,
mechanism (a) is right.

PolegPolsky2016 reports that NMDA receptors multiplicatively scale excitatory drive by ~2x and
sharpen directional discrimination, but the survey did not find a published ablation that
isolates the NMDA contribution independently of the AMPA+GABA core. Run three configurations
on the reproduced DSGC baseline (AMPA+GABA only, AMPA+GABA+NMDA with PolegPolsky2016 NMDA
parameters, AMPA+GABA+NMDA with NMDA_gain swept 1-4x) and report the DSI, peak rate, and HWHM
trajectories. This answers a specific open RQ3/RQ4-adjacent question that the literature
states but does not isolate experimentally. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

The t0022 scheduler uses GABA_CONDUCTANCE_NULL_NS = 12 nS applied 10 ms before AMPA on
null-direction trials - about 4x the preferred value (3 nS) and 2x Schachter2010's measured
compound null inhibition (~6 nS). This oversized early shunt forces null-direction firing to
exactly 0 Hz, pinning the pref/null DSI denominator and the ratio at 1.000 before cable
mechanics have any effect. Sweep GABA_CONDUCTANCE_NULL_NS across {3, 6, 9, 12} nS at a fixed
length multiplier of 1.0x and locate the conductance at which null-direction firing first
exceeds 1 Hz. That value is the testbed's sensitivity edge. Prerequisite for S-0029-01 and
S-0029-02: rerunning the length sweep at 6 nS instead of 12 nS gives the
mechanism-discrimination experiment a fighting chance without needing to inject noise. ~30 min
CPU. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

The t0022 driver has three free per-dendrite parameters fixed at single points:
EI_OFFSET_PREFERRED_MS = 10 ms, GABA_NULL/GABA_PREF ratio = 4x (12 nS / 3 nS), AMPA
conductance = 6 nS. Run a factorial sweep over EI_OFFSET in {5, 10, 15} ms, GABA ratio in {2,
3, 4, 6}, and AMPA in {0.15, 0.3, 0.6} nS (the last anchored to Park2014's 0.31 nS somatic
measurement) to quantify mechanism robustness. Expected outcome: a (3 x 4 x 3) = 36-point DSI
response surface showing which E-I corner of the parameter space saturates DSI at 1.0 (driver
is too deterministic) vs produces a graded DSI in the Park2014 0.65 +/- 0.05 band (mechanism
tracks continuous inhibition as real DSGCs do). Dependencies: t0022 library asset. Effort ~20

Sibling of S-0029-01 (Poisson + length sweep) targeting the diameter axis. The t0030
deterministic testbed yields reliability = 1.000 and null firing 0 Hz at every diameter, which
collapses the rate-code noise floor that Schachter2010's dendritic-spike-threshold mechanism
and Dan2018's passive-TR derivation both assume. Add an independent 5 Hz background Poisson
NetStim per distal dendrite (independent seed, no direction bias) to the t0022 scheduler and
rerun the full 7-point diameter sweep (0.5x-2.0x, 12 angles x 10 trials = 840 trials).
Expected: DSI drops from 1.000 into the 0.6-0.8 Park2014 envelope, reliability drops below
1.0, and diameter regains discrimination power between Schachter2010 active amplification
(+slope) and passive filtering (-slope). Distinct from S-0022-05 (Poisson at a single

t0072 produced a recording infrastructure that works across both Bed A (HOC-driven BIPsyn /
SACinhib / SACexc) and Bed B (Python-driven Exp2Syn ACh / GABA via NetStim+NetCon). Extends
t0048's BIPsyn-only attach_conductance_recorders (proposed as S-0047-04 for Bed A only) along
three new axes: (1) per-synapse local v via point_process.get_segment()._ref_v rather than
only g, (2) automatic uS->nS unit conversion when the mechanism uses uS (Bed B Exp2Syn
convention), (3) post-hoc per-synapse current I = g_nS * (v_local_mV - E_rev_mV) in pA with
E_rev sourced from MOD PARAMETERs. Package: (a) attach_g_v_recorders(cell, synapse_lists,

t0072's per-synapse recordings surfaced a counter-intuitive Bed A finding: mean peak g_NMDA is
0.30 nS at PD vs 0.19 nS at ND (~37% drop) despite identical BIPsyn release envelopes between
directions. The mechanism is the Jahr-Stevens Mg block: stronger ND inhibition keeps dendritic
v more hyperpolarised, deepening the voltage-dependent block and lowering realised gNMDA. Run
a focused 2-D sweep on the Bed A substrate (t0008/t0020 builder) varying (gabaMOD, [Mg2+]_o)
over a 5x5 grid at fixed PD/ND bar geometry, recording per-synapse g_NMDA and v_local with the
same recorder pattern as t0072, and producing the surface (g_NMDA_ND - g_NMDA_PD) vs (gabaMOD
ratio, [Mg2+]_o). Cross-check against a Voff_bipNMDA = 1 control (voltage-independent NMDA
from t0048) which should flatten the surface to ~0. Distinct from S-0026-06 (V_rest
TTX/NMDA-block sweep on t0022/t0024) and S-0048-* (DSI-vs-gNMDA at fixed Mg2+). Recommended

Alternative 'fix path B' to S-0050-01: instead of modulating gabaMOD per synapse, modify the
construction loop in RGCmodel.hoc:11839-11857 so SACinhib synapses are placed asymmetrically
across the dendritic field (more on the ND-side, fewer on the PD-side) while leaving BIPsyn
and SACexcsyn at the deposited 282-symmetric distribution. t0050 found total dendritic length
per side is essentially identical (2311 vs 2296 um) so the dendritic substrate supports an
asymmetric placement at construction. Test whether the somatic SEClamp PD/ND asymmetry reaches
paper Fig 3C targets without changing per-synapse gabaMOD. This decouples the deposited 'three
channels share parent sections per index' design and is a more invasive but mechanistically
cleaner option. Recommended task types: feature-engineering, experiment-run.

The t0022 `_silence_baseline_hoc_synapses` sets b2gnmda = 0 and installs single-component
AMPA-only E-I pairs, removing the Espinosa2010 AMPA/NMDA kinetic-tiling mechanism from the
testable space entirely. Espinosa2010 proposes that DSGC DS arises from different activation
time courses of AMPA and NMDA interacting with cable propagation delay - predicting
non-monotonic DSI-vs-length because NMDA's 50-150 ms time constant resonates with propagation
delay at specific lengths. Modify `_silence_baseline_hoc_synapses` to restore b2gnmda at 30%
of the 189347 baseline and rerun the 7-point length sweep. If DSI drops below 1.000 with
non-monotonic length dependence, kinetic tiling is a real third mechanism and the current null
result was partially a function of NMDA silencing. Requires a sibling library asset (clone of
t0022 with NMDA enabled) to preserve t0022's immutability. ~1 hour CPU plus ~1 hour coding.

computed per synapse from each synapse's locx relative to the BIPsyn-locx median (88.77 um) or
soma_x (104.58 um), scaling up ND-side synapses and down PD-side synapses while preserving the

ms trial window is shorter than the time the cell needs to drop below V_rest + (V_peak -
V_rest)/e once 100 simultaneous NMDA Exp2Syn events with tau2=80 ms keep Vm depolarised. The
headline numerical answer to 'how does EPSP tau scale with gNMDA?' is missing -- this is a
metric implementation gap, not a biological null result. Implement two changes: (1) extend the

t0065 IPSP_PASSIVE traces are flat at e_SACinhib = -60 mV because the cell sits at the
inhibitory reversal under no excitation. The voltage trace cannot reveal the inhibitory
conductance time-course; only a voltage clamp can resolve g_inh(t). t0049 already has SEClamp
infrastructure for this cell. Combining the t0065 channel-isolation pattern (zero excitatory
drives via b2gampa = b2gnmda = s2gach = achMOD = 0) with a SEClamp at -65 mV (or any
non-equilibrium voltage offset from e_SACinhib) would resolve the inhibitory conductance in nS
as a function of time, separately for PD (gabaMOD = 0.33) and ND (gabaMOD = 0.99). This is
essential for quantifying the differential shunting magnitude that drives FULL-mode DSI: the
integral of g_inh(t) should be ~3x larger in ND than in PD. Expected output: two conductance
time-courses showing g_inhibitory(t) over the 1000 ms trial in PD vs ND, with peak g_inh and
integrated charge per direction.

determine why the deposited code instantiates 282 BIP/SACinhib/SACexc terminals when the paper
Methods text states 177 synapses. Test alternative cut-plane thresholds, density-based
sub-sampling, or supplementary-text geometry rules to find a code configuration that matches
the paper count. The 1.6x synapse overcount is the leading mechanistic hypothesis for the ~4x

t0049 ran SEClamp at the single V_clamp = -65 mV which yields a small GABA driving force (-5
mV vs E_GABA = -60 mV) and amplifies noise on the GABA conductance estimate (SD +/- 1.98 nS at
PD). Repeat the per-channel isolation sweep at V_clamp in {-85, -65, -45} mV. The -85 mV
condition gives a 25 mV GABA driving force (5x improvement in GABA SNR) and inverts the
AMPA/NMDA driving force; the -45 mV condition reverses the GABA driving force sign and
increases NMDA Mg-block relief. Tests (a) whether the GABA PD/ND symmetry persists across
V_clamp (ruling out driving-force noise), (b) whether NMDA over-amplification depends on
holding voltage. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

Voltage trace cannot resolve g_inh(t) when e_GABA = v_rest (zero current at rest regardless of
g). For the de Rosenroll cell specifically, combine the t0066 channel-isolation pattern (set
ach NetCon weights = 0; HHst zeroed) with a SEClamp at -65 mV (or any non-equilibrium offset
from e_GABA = -60). This will read inhibitory current in pA across the trial separately for PD
(gaba_release_prob = 0.05) and ND (gaba_release_prob = 0.80). Expected: the time-integrated
charge in ND should be ~3-16x larger than in PD depending on how synapse-level release prob
translates to mean conductance. Reuses t0049's SEClamp infrastructure (which was developed for
the deposited cell — would need a small port for the de Rosenroll synapse model). Parallel to
S-0065-03 for the deposited cell; together they give cross-model conductance benchmarks.

the population mean peak (0.16 nS PD; 1.25 nS ND). The Bernoulli release model means most of
177 GABA terminals fire 0-1 events per trial; a handful of high-rate terminals near the bar's
arrival window summate to large momentary conductances. Test whether these hot-spots cluster
spatially: project each terminal's centroid onto the bar-projection axis (0 deg vs 180 deg),
bin into N=10 bands. For each band compute (a) Bernoulli release probability per trial
(analytic from _gaba_prob_for_direction sigmoid + AR(2) envelope), (b) realised mean peak g

t0053's centripetal-gating rule fires every I synapse whose centrifugal vector is anywhere on
the bar-incoming hemisphere (cos(theta_stim - theta_centrifugal) < 0), giving a roughly 50%
active fraction averaged over directions and a 0.34-0.66 per-direction spread. With 2 nS GABA
per active synapse this is enough to fully suppress spiking. Tighten the threshold to T in
{-0.3, -0.5, -0.7, -0.866} so only synapses whose centrifugal vector is within (90 - acos|T|)
of being directly anti-aligned with the bar fire. T = -0.5 reduces mean active fraction to
~0.33; T = -0.866 to ~0.17. Re-run the 12-direction x 10-trial FULL sweep at fixed 2 nS GABA
per synapse and report peak Hz, DSI, HWHM, active-fraction polar curve, and aggregate IPSP per
T. Goal: test whether a stricter threshold recovers a measurable DSI without changing
per-synapse conductance, isolating the active-fraction-vs-amplitude contributions to
suppression. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

t0057 swept GABA_BASE_NS in {0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0} nS and found a binary regime: gaba <=
1.0 nS produces uniform 0.667 Hz single-spike-per-trial (tonic too weak to override AMPA
spike) and gaba >= 1.5 nS produces 0 Hz full suppression. The sub-0.25 nS regime is
uncharacterised and may host a graded-suppression operating point where the tonic envelope
partially vetoes the AMPA spike on subset of trials, producing a probabilistic firing-rate
signal that could carry direction information. Run a finer sweep at GABA_BASE_NS in {0.05,

t0057 introduced a sustained (1300 ms) tonic envelope on the t0053 spatial substrate; the

to the wild-type tiling. Prediction (creative_thinking.md #2): if [Srivastava2022]
kinetic-tiling is causally responsible for SAC DS, the swap reverses preferred direction; if
[Kim2014] cable delay is causal, the swap only reduces DSI magnitude without flipping
preferred direction. Critical for choosing between two competing centrifugal-DS mechanisms

t0068 makes clear that channel-level rescue may not be possible — the GABA shunt's leverage is
fundamentally bounded when Nav1.6 boosts the depolarising drive. The natural alternative is to
scale the GABA conductance up proportionally. Test: at Nav1.6_med (s2ggaba x 1.5x, 2.0x, 3.0x)
and Nav1.6_high (s2ggaba x 1.5x, 2.0x, 3.0x). Hypothesis: a coordinated 2x synaptic upscale
restores DSI to baseline. This isn't a 'rescue' in the channel-pharmacology sense, but it
shows what would be required to compensate for a Nav-side gain change at the network level —
relevant for understanding RGC robustness to channel-density variation. Implementation: 1-line

1.94x active-count ratio -> 1.24x voltage ratio at fixed 2 nS per synapse. Build a calibration
library `gaba_drive_saturation` taking both t0052 and t0053 IPSP data and fitting a two-point

within rounding), (b) peak Hz does NOT remain at 0.667 Hz in FULL mode (NMDA contributes,
unlike t0055 Voff = 0 case). This isolates the Mg-block voltage-gating as the sole cause of
the t0055 NMDA-inert behavior and gives a controlled within-task ablation. Pass criterion: DSI
at gNMDA = 0.25, FULL with Voff = 1 matches t0054 within +/-0.05; peak Hz exceeds 0.667 Hz at
gNMDA >= 0.25. Recommended task type: experiment-run.

The t0070 writeup confirms Bed B vendors `Exp2NMDA.mod` (103 lines) and parameterises NMDA in
`tasks/t0024_port_de_rosenroll_2026_dsgc/code/constants.py:L57-L61` (NMDA_TAU1_MS=2,

but `_setup_synapses` (`run_tuning_curve.py:L189-L226`) never instantiates an Exp2NMDA point
process. Bed A always runs with NMDA, Bed B never does. Project literature (Poleg-Polsky 2016,
t0048, t0054, t0055, t0057) identifies voltage-dependent NMDA Mg-block as a critical
multiplicative-gain mechanism for DS. Extend `_setup_synapses` to place one Exp2NMDA per

t0066 only tested PD (0°) and ND (180°). The de Rosenroll model's bar-geometry direction
encoding produces continuous tuning across angles. Running EPSP_PASSIVE / IPSP_PASSIVE / FULL
at all 12 angles (0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°) would produce an EPSP/IPSP decomposition for the
entire tuning curve, showing how the bar-geometry contribution to direction sensitivity
(visible as ~1.6 mV PD-vs-ND difference in EPSP_PASSIVE) varies with angle. Most informative
for: identifying the angle where the bar-geometry contribution maximises (probably ~90° from
preferred), and characterising whether the GABA shunt-driven DS scales linearly across angles
or has a threshold. Sweep cost: 12 angles x 3 modes x 20 trials x ~30 s/trial = ~6 hours.
Could parallelise across CPU cores (each angle independent) to reduce wall-clock to ~1.5
hours.

t0022 applies only null-direction GABA. Published DSGC models (Park2014, Schachter2010)
include a directionally-offset SAC inhibition where preferred-direction trials see much lower
GABA than null. Implement the cartwheel asymmetry as a new parameter
`GABA_CONDUCTANCE_PREF_NS` (probably 0-1 nS based on t0037's over-excitation regime below 2
nS), and measure whether primary DSI improves toward the 0.5-0.6 Park2014 centre. This moves
t0022 closer to the canonical DSGC E-I motif rather than relying on a single null-only scalar.

t0065 only tests gabaMOD = 0.33 (PD) and 0.99 (ND). The Poleg-Polsky 2016 paper has a smooth
tuning curve over 8 directions, which the deposited model simulates by sweeping gabaMOD across
[0.33, 0.99]. Running EPSP_PASSIVE / IPSP_PASSIVE / FULL at all 8 directions would produce an
EPSP/IPSP decomposition for the entire tuning curve, not just the two anchor points. Most
informative for understanding how shunting modulates the EPSP envelope at intermediate
directions: does the relationship between gabaMOD and FULL-mode envelope compression scale
linearly, or is there a threshold around gabaMOD ~ 0.6 where the cell transitions from spiking
to non-spiking? Sweep cost: 24 trials (3 modes x 8 directions x 1 seed) ≈ 75 s. Expected
output: 24-trial dataset with gabaMOD-modulated tuning curve in spike counts and the
corresponding (constant) EPSP_PASSIVE and (constant-flat) IPSP_PASSIVE traces.

t0055 used a single placement seed (= 0) for cross-task regression with t0054. The
bit-identical DSI = 0.7464 across all gNMDA is mechanistically interpretable but rests on a
single placement. Re-run the FULL/EPSP_PASSIVE/IPSP_PASSIVE trio at gNMDA = 0.5 nS for 10
placement seeds {0..9} and report mean +/- SD of vector-sum DSI, peak Hz, EPSP peak, and
Mg-block g(v) summary. This hardens the t0055 conclusion by showing the NMDA-inert regime is a
structural property of the architecture, not a coincidence of one synapse layout. Pass
criterion: DSI mean - SD remains > 0.50 (i.e., the Mg-block DSI recovery is robust across
placement seeds). Recommended task type: experiment-run.

t0047 ran a noise sweep at exptype=1 (Voff_bipNMDA=0). Now that t0048 establishes
Voff_bipNMDA=1 as the paper-faithful NMDA condition, the corresponding question is whether
t0047's noise vs DSI relationship (DSI declining with flickerVAR across the three gNMDA
conditions) holds under the voltage-independent setting. Re-run the same flickerVAR x gNMDA
grid t0047 used (or a reduced 3 x 3 grid to bound CPU) at exptype=2 and compare the
noise-vs-DSI shape. Useful corollary to t0048's gNMDA finding because it tells us whether the
noise sensitivity is dominated by NMDA voltage-dependence or by AMPA/GABA balance. Lower
priority because (a) t0047 already provides the qualitative noise-vs-DSI shape and (b) the H2
verdict for the Voff=1 DSI baseline is unlikely to be qualitatively different under noise.

The t0024 constants file documents that the de Rosenroll 2026 paper text specifies
ELEAK_PAPER_TEXT = -70 mV (a true hyperpolarising rest below e_GABA = -60), but the upstream
code authority used -60 mV. Re-run the t0066 EPSP/IPSP/FULL protocol with ELEAK = -70 mV (and
V_INIT = -70 mV) to test the paper-text variant. Prediction: IPSP_PASSIVE will become a real
hyperpolarising trace (PD ~-65 mV, ND ~-69 mV — closer to e_GABA = -60 mV with proportional
displacement); FULL DSI may change because the cell now sits 5 mV further from spike
threshold. This both quantifies the paper-vs-code discrepancy and gives us a reference
'hyperpolarising IPSP' DSGC for cross-comparison. Cost: re-run the same 120-trial sweep with
two constants changed = 1 line of code + 1 hour compute.

t0054 demonstrated that voltage-independent NMDA (Exp2Syn, no Mg block) collapses vector-sum
DSI from 0.746 (gNMDA=0) to 0.082 (gNMDA=0.25) to 0.017 (gNMDA=1.0), confirming
PolegPolsky2016's prediction [Fig 5] that the Boltzmann Mg block is required for
multiplicative DSI scaling. Replace the NMDA Exp2Syn with a Jahr-Stevens Mg-block point
process (e.g., bipolarNMDA.mod from PolegPolsky2016 or an equivalent NMDA_Mg2 MOD), keeping
all other t0054 parameters fixed (placement seed 0, AMPA tau1=0.5/tau2=2.5/0.5 nS, scalar

Under SEClamp at -65 mV, the deposited code's GABA shows PD/ND symmetry (47.47 vs 48.04 nS,
DSI -0.006) instead of the paper's clear ND-bias (12.5 vs 30 nS, DSI -0.41). NMDA also
collapses to symmetry (DSI 0.006 vs paper +0.17). Modality alone does not reconcile this.
Audit `placeBIP()` and any GABA-placement HOC code in the deposited DSGC: extract per-synapse
3D coordinates and section assignments, classify each synapse by PD-side vs ND-side dendrite,

(100 nS mean total per trial) fully suppresses spiking on the t0009-calibrated morphology.

t0057 used a global (t_on, t_off) = (100 ms, 1400 ms) for every active synapse regardless of
dendritic position. Biological SAC inhibition is bar-arrival-locked: each SAC outputs GABA
only as the bar passes its dendritic field, producing a synapse-specific window of width
~100-300 ms. On t0057's minimal_dsgc_tonic_gaba_sweep substrate, modify schedule_ei_onsets so
each centripetally-active I synapse gets t_on = (x*cos(theta) + y*sin(theta))/v + offset_ms

t0047 records `_ref_g` directly at each synapse and obtains summed peak conductances 6-9x the
paper's Fig 3A-E targets and per-synapse-mean values 28-90x under. Neither interpretation
reconciles. The paper's Fig 3A-E most likely reports a somatic voltage-clamp-recorded compound
conductance — a third quantity not measured here. Implement a NEURON SEClamp at the soma held
at -65 mV across the same 7-point gNMDA sweep, record `_ref_i` on the clamp, and deconvolve
per-channel conductance via `g(t) = i(t) / (V_clamp - e_rev)` with `e_NMDA = e_AMPA = 0` and
`e_SACinhib = -60 mV`. Compare against paper targets within +/- 25%. Distinct from S-0046-02
(synapse-count) and S-0046-05 (supplementary PDF); also distinct from S-0019-XX which targets
a downstream model build, not the deposited code. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

t0047 confirms DSI vs gNMDA peaks at 0.19 near b2gnmda = 0.5 nS and decays to 0.018 by 3.0 nS,
never reaching the paper's claimed flat ~0.30. Most plausible source: the deposited control's
`Voff_bipNMDA = 0` (voltage-dependent NMDA with Mg block). As gNMDA rises, ND dendrites
depolarise enough to relieve Mg block and ND NMDA catches up to PD, collapsing DSI. The
paper's biological NMDA is voltage-INDEPENDENT. Direct test: re-execute the same 7-point sweep
(PD/ND, 4+ trials) at `exptype = 2` (sets `Voff_bipNMDA = 1`, the same setting used by 0Mg)
instead of `exptype = 1`. Expected: DSI flattens toward ~0.20-0.30 across the sweep. Not a
model modification — only an exptype choice. Re-uses t0046 library and t0047's
`code/run_with_conductances.py` directly. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

PolegPolsky2016 (paper 10.1016_j.neuron.2016.02.013) is the closest published match to this
project's goal — a NEURON multi-compartmental mouse ON-OFF DSGC model with 177 AMPA + 177 GABA
synapses and NMDA multiplicative gain — with public code at ModelDB entry 189347. Download the
ModelDB code, run the original published stimulus, and verify the reproduced tuning curve
lands inside the published DSI 0.7-0.85 / peak 40-80 Hz / null < 10 Hz / HWHM 60-90 deg
envelope. This creates the reference implementation the later parameter-variation tasks (Na/K
grid, morphology sweep, E/I ratio scan) will fork from. Recommended task types:
code-reproduction.

The t0030 sweep failed as a Schachter2010-vs-passive-filtering discriminator because primary
DSI is pinned at 1.000 at every diameter multiplier (null firing 0 Hz under the t0022 E-I
schedule). compare_literature.md traces the ceiling to GABA_CONDUCTANCE_NULL_NS = 12 nS
delivered 10 ms before AMPA on null trials, about 2x Schachter2010's compound null inhibition
(~6 nS). Rerun the full 7-point diameter sweep (0.5x-2.0x, 12 angles x 10 trials = 840 trials)
with GABA_CONDUCTANCE_NULL_NS lowered to 6 nS so null firing becomes non-zero and primary DSI
regains dynamic range. Distinct from S-0029-04 (null-GABA sweep at fixed length 1.0x) and
S-0029-01 (Poisson + length sweep): this targets the diameter axis specifically. Expected
cost: local CPU, ~2 h wall time. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

t0036 halved GABA_CONDUCTANCE_NULL_NS from 12 nS to 6 nS and null firing stayed pinned at 0.0
Hz at every diameter multiplier, falsifying the Schachter2010 ~6 nS compound-inhibition
rescue. The classifier auto-recommendation was 'reduce null-GABA further to ~4 nS'. Rerun the
t0036 diameter sweep at 4 nS, 2 nS, and 1 nS (stop as soon as mean null firing exceeds 0.1 Hz
at 1.0x); each rerun is ~30 min CPU so worst case ~1.5 h. If null firing unpins at 4 or 2 nS,
primary DSI becomes measurable and the Schachter2010-vs-passive slope discriminator is rescued
on deterministic t0022. If it stays 0 Hz down to 1 nS, the testbed is structurally
incompatible with primary DSI on morphology axes and the project must adopt Poisson rescue
(S-0030-02) or migrate the optimiser substrate to t0024 (S-0034-07). Distinct from S-0029-04
(3-12 nS at fixed length on t0029 code) - this extends below the 3 nS floor on the t0036
diameter-sweep code path. Recommended task types: experiment-run.
