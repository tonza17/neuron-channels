<summary>📚 <strong>Build a small reusable library for target-vs-simulated tuning
curve metrics</strong> (S-0004-03)</summary>

| Field | Value |

| **Kind** | library |

| **Categories** | [`direction-selectivity`](../../meta/categories/direction-selectivity/) |

Factor the closed-form DSI, HWHM, tuning_curve_rmse, and tuning_curve_reliability computations
out of individual tasks into a shared library asset. Every later fitting task will need these
four functions; centralising them avoids divergent reimplementations and makes metric values
reproducible from parameters alone.

<summary>🧪 <strong>Factorial (g_Na, g_K) grid search on a DSGC compartmental model

No paper in the 20-paper corpus (including Fohlmeister2010, Schachter2010, PolegPolsky2016,
Vaney2012) reports a factorial grid search over somatic (g_Na, g_K) pairs for a DSGC — this is
the central gap identified for RQ1 by the survey. Run a grid with g_Na swept across 0.02-0.20
S/cm^2 and g_K (delayed rectifier) swept across 0.003-0.050 S/cm^2 on the baseline DSGC
morphology and 177+177 synaptic budget, record DSI, preferred peak, null residual, and
tuning-curve HWHM at each point, and publish the ridge of combinations that hit DSI 0.7-0.85
with peak 40-80 Hz and null < 10 Hz. This directly supplies the RQ1 answer the project needs.
Recommended task types: experiment-run.

<summary>🧪 <strong>Factorial morphology sweep (branch orders, segment length,
segment diameter) at fixed synapse count</strong> (S-0002-04)</summary>

| Field | Value |

ElQuessny2021 concludes that global DSGC morphology has only a minor effect on the synaptic
E/I distribution, but the survey finds no paper that runs a clean factorial sweep over the
three local-electrotonic knobs separately. With synaptic count fixed at the PolegPolsky
177+177 baseline and dendrites set to active (Schachter2010 densities), vary (number of branch
orders, mean segment length, mean segment diameter) on an orthogonal grid, record DSI and HWHM
per point, and test whether segment diameter has the largest effect (as cable theory
predicts). This directly answers RQ2 and provides the morphology-sensitivity map the project
currently lacks. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

<summary>🧪 <strong>Paired active-vs-passive dendrite experiment to reproduce the
Schachter2010 DSI gain (~0.3 -> ~0.7)</strong> (S-0002-02)</summary>

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **ID** | `S-0002-02` |
| **Kind** | experiment |
| **Date added** | 2026-04-19 |

Schachter2010 reports that switching DSGC dendrites from passive to active (adding
Fohlmeister-like g_Na and g_K) raises DSI from ~0.3 to ~0.7 on the same morphology and
synaptic input, and Oesch2005 provides the TTX-sensitive dendritic Na+ spike patch-clamp data
that anchor this claim. Run two paired simulations that differ only in dendritic g_Na (0 vs
Schachter2010 density), holding morphology, synapse placement, and stimulus identical, and
report the DSI delta with 95% CI across synapse-placement seeds. This directly answers RQ4 and
isolates the dendritic-conductance contribution from morphology and synaptic effects.
Recommended task types: experiment-run, comparative-analysis.

Download ModelDB 189347 (the only public DSGC NEURON model), re-run its included demo, and
register the resulting Python package as a library asset under `assets/library/`. This makes
the DSGC reference implementation available to every downstream simulation task without

The t0007 sanity sims only exercise NEURON's built-in hh mechanism. khhchan.mod is compiled as
a smoke test but its biophysics are never run. Add a short task that inserts khhchan on a
1-compartment soma, drives it with the same IClamp protocol, and compares the resulting trace
against the built-in hh to confirm the custom mechanism produces physiologically plausible
spikes before downstream retinal tasks depend on it.

At the single-compartment size, NetPyNE's setup is ~6× slower than raw NEURON (38.7 ms vs 6.7
ms) but runtime is indistinguishable. Scan both harnesses across realistic retinal network
sizes (1, 10, 100, 1000 cells; dense and sparse connectivity) to quantify where NetPyNE's cost
becomes significant for downstream t0008 / t0010 / t0011 runs, and decide whether any hot-loop
experiments should stay in raw NEURON.

Once a DSGC model runs in NEURON (via S-0003-02), port the same morphology and channel set to
Arbor 0.12.0 and measure single-cell simulation wall-clock on the project's workstation.
Third-party benchmarks claim Arbor is 7-12x faster; this task validates that claim on our
actual use case and records the real cost of the NMODL `modcc` translation that t0003 flagged
as the main Arbor adoption risk.

| **Source paper** | — |
| **Categories** | [`compartmental-modeling`](../../meta/categories/compartmental-modeling/), [`retinal-ganglion-cell`](../../meta/categories/retinal-ganglion-cell/) |

Every downstream compartmental-modelling task in this project will need to load the
dsgc-baseline-morphology SWC into a simulator and produce a section/segment graph indexed by
SWC compartment id, soma reference, and per-section parent links. NEURON's built-in Import3d
handling of CNG SWCs is fragile (soma-3point convention, branch-point splitting, axon stubs)
and other simulators have their own quirks (NetPyNE's netParams.cellParams, Arbor's morphology
builder). Write a small library asset that exposes a pure-function
load_dsgc_morphology(simulator: str) -> SimulatorMorphology API with verified-equivalent
loaders for NEURON, NetPyNE, and Arbor, plus a smoke test that compares total path length and
compartment count across loaders against validate_swc.py. This eliminates per-task SWC-loading
bugs and keeps morphology choice swappable when S-0005-03 lands. Recommended task types:
write-library.

The current dsgc-baseline-morphology commits the project to a single reconstructed cell
(141009_Pair1DSGC). Cell-to-cell variability in branching pattern, total path length, and
arbor extent is a known source of variance in DSGC tuning curves (RQ2), and the Feller archive
on NeuroMorpho hosts several sibling ON-OFF DSGC reconstructions from the same lab (e.g.,
141009_Pair2DSGC and other 2014 Pair* records). Download 3-5 additional Feller-archive ON-OFF
DSGC SWCs as separate dataset assets (each with its own NeuroMorpho neuron_id and provenance),
validate each with the existing validate_swc.py parser, and tabulate per-cell compartment
count, branch points, and total dendritic path length so a downstream morphology-sweep task
can quantify cross-cell variability without committing a priori to a specific morphology.
Recommended task types: download-dataset.

Nature), Enciso2010 (SAC-network compartmental model, J Comp Neurosci), and the Webvision-DSGC
review. Sivyer2017 and Euler2002 directly constrain RQ4 and the presynaptic drive for RQ3, and
Enciso2010 provides a compartmental SAC-network model that could seed the presynaptic GABA
input for the DSGC model. Download them via /add-paper in a dedicated task and extend the

PolegPolsky2016 sets GABA/AMPA at 1:1 (177/177), while Park2014 and Taylor2002 constrain the
null/preferred IPSC ratio to 3-5x but not the total GABA density. Scan the GABA/AMPA density
ratio from 0.5 to 4.0 (keeping the 3-5x null asymmetry fixed, the 40-80 Hz preferred peak
fixed by the Na/K ridge, and the morphology and dendritic conductances fixed) and report how
tuning-curve HWHM and preferred peak rate co-vary. The expected pattern (sharper tuning at the
cost of lower peak rate) is stated in research_internet.md as hypothesis H4 but is not yet
tested in the literature. This directly refines the RQ3 answer. Recommended task types:

Create sibling dataset assets (e.g., target-tuning-curve-weak-dsi,
target-tuning-curve-mid-dsi) with the same generator but r_peak values chosen so DSI lands at
~0.65 and ~0.75. Lets downstream fitting tasks test whether the optimisation pipeline is
robust across the 0.6-0.9 band instead of only the upper end.

PolegPolsky2016 reports that NMDA receptors multiplicatively scale excitatory drive by ~2x and
sharpen directional discrimination, but the survey did not find a published ablation that
isolates the NMDA contribution independently of the AMPA+GABA core. Run three configurations
on the reproduced DSGC baseline (AMPA+GABA only, AMPA+GABA+NMDA with PolegPolsky2016 NMDA
parameters, AMPA+GABA+NMDA with NMDA_gain swept 1-4x) and report the DSI, peak rate, and HWHM
trajectories. This answers a specific open RQ3/RQ4-adjacent question that the literature
states but does not isolate experimentally. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

Briggman2011 (SBEM wiring) and Ding2016 (cross-species comparison) supply the structural E/I
bias; Park2014 and Taylor2002 supply the 3-5x null/preferred IPSC amplitudes;
Sethuramanujam2016 adds ACh/GABA co-release; Hanson2019 challenges the pure SAC-asymmetry
model. Consolidate these findings into a pre-built SAC presynaptic drive asset (a reusable
library or dataset: angle-dependent GABA conductance time courses, AMPA time courses, and
their spatial distributions on a DSGC) so downstream DSGC simulation tasks do not each
re-implement the presynaptic waveform construction. The asset should expose a pure-function
API that takes (stimulus angle, velocity, asymmetry parameter) and returns per-synapse
conductance time courses. Recommended task types: write-library, feature-engineering.

The dsgc-baseline-morphology asset is currently described only by tabulated statistics (6,736
compartments, 129 branch points, 1,536.25 um path length). Downstream tasks that place
AMPA/GABA synapses by spatial rule (e.g., Park2014 3-5x null/preferred IPSC asymmetry,
S-0002-05 GABA/AMPA density scan) need a visual reference for the dendritic arbor,
branch-order map, and soma orientation; reviewers also need a figure for any project paper.
Render three QA visualisations (2D top-down dendrogram coloured by Strahler order, 2D xy
projection coloured by path distance from soma, 3D rotating xyz scatter) using neurom +
matplotlib (or NEURON's PlotShape) and register the figures plus the rendering script as an
answer asset describing what was checked. Flag any visible reconstruction artefacts (dangling
branches, axon stubs, soma asymmetry) for downstream tasks. Recommended task types:
data-analysis, answer-question.

Park2014 (paper 10.1523_JNEUROSCI.5017-13.2014) and Chen2009 (paper
10.1113_jphysiol.2008.161240) are the two papers that set the mouse ON-OFF DSGC RQ5 targets
(DSI 0.6-0.9, peak 40-80 Hz, HWHM 60-90 deg). Park2014 is available open-access. Digitise the
published tuning-curve figure(s) into a reusable dataset asset (angle in degrees, spike rate
in Hz, error bars, cell counts) so the model can be scored against measured data rather than
only against the analytic target in t0004. This gives the project a literature-grounded

drives the install with the correct prefix (either by default-install-then-move or by a
chocolatey recipe), (c) writes the .pth file into the uv venv, and (d) runs nrnivmodl + both
sanity sims end-to-end. This unblocks automated reproduction on a fresh Windows machine and
Linux / macOS CI runners.

Replace the current Gaussian-noise trial replicates with Poisson counts converted to rates
(Fano factor ~1) and register it as a separate dataset asset. This would give
tuning_curve_reliability a noise model closer to real spike statistics while keeping the
closed-form mean curve unchanged.

NEURON 9.0.0 and 9.0.1 (Sep-Nov 2025) migrate MOD-file semantics to C++ and add Python 3.14
wheels. The t0003 survey picked 8.2.7 for conservatism. Create a task that (1) installs 9.0.1
into a sandbox venv, (2) rebuilds the Poleg-Polsky 189347 DSGC model from S-0003-02 under
9.0.x, (3) runs the existing DSGC simulations under both 8.2.7 and 9.0.1, and (4) records any
behavioural differences. This decides whether the project should upgrade before or after the
first round of tuning-curve experiments.

Every compartment in the downloaded CNG SWC carries the placeholder radius 0.125 um because
the original Simple Neurite Tracer reconstruction did not record diameters. Cable-theory
predicts segment diameter is the single most influential local-electrotonic knob (see
S-0002-04), so leaving the uniform placeholder in place will silently bias every downstream
biophysical simulation (axial resistance, attenuation, spike initiation threshold). Build a
diameter-calibration pipeline that applies a literature-derived order-dependent diameter taper
(e.g., Vaney/Sivyer/Taylor 2012 mouse ON-OFF DSGC profile, or the Poleg-Polsky 2016
distribution) keyed on Strahler order or path distance from the soma, write the calibrated SWC
as a new dataset asset (e.g., dsgc-baseline-morphology-calibrated), and report the per-order
diameter distribution against the original placeholder. Recommended task types:
feature-engineering, data-analysis.

The dsgc-baseline-morphology asset (NeuroMorpho neuron 102976, 141009_Pair1DSGC) currently has
source_paper_id=null because two Feller-lab papers from 2018 are plausibly the source: the
plan-nominated Morrie & Feller 2018 Neuron (DOI 10.1016/j.neuron.2018.05.028) and the

The survey surfaces four concurrent numerical targets an optimised DSGC model must hit (DSI
0.7-0.85, preferred peak 40-80 Hz, null residual < 10 Hz, HWHM 60-90 deg), and the project has
four registered metrics (direction_selectivity_index, tuning_curve_hwhm_deg,
tuning_curve_reliability, tuning_curve_rmse). Build a scoring library that takes a simulated
angle-to-AP-rate tuning curve plus the canonical target curve from t0004 and returns a single
scalar loss combining all four targets with documented weights (e.g., weighted Euclidean
distance in normalised space), plus per-metric residuals. This is the tool every downstream
optimisation task (Na/K grid, morphology sweep, E/I ratio scan) will depend on. Recommended
task types: write-library.

virtualenv, compiles the bundled Hodgkin-Huxley MOD files with `nrnivmodl`, runs a
1-compartment sanity simulation, and records the installed versions, install-time warnings,

synapses and NMDA multiplicative gain — with public code at ModelDB entry 189347. Download the
ModelDB code, run the original published stimulus, and verify the reproduced tuning curve
lands inside the published DSI 0.7-0.85 / peak 40-80 Hz / null < 10 Hz / HWHM 60-90 deg
envelope. This creates the reference implementation the later parameter-variation tasks (Na/K
