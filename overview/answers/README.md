<summary><strong>Does the NEURON 8.2.7 + NetPyNE 1.1.1 toolchain install, compile
MOD files, and run a 1-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley sanity simulation on
the project's Windows 11 workstation?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: high

Yes. NEURON 8.2.7+ (HEAD 34cf696+, build 2025-05-21) installs via the Windows `.exe` binary
wired into the uv venv with a `.pth` file, NetPyNE 1.1.1 installs via `uv pip`, `nrnivmodl`
compiles `khhchan.mod` into `nrnmech.dll` with no errors, and both sanity simulations (raw
NEURON and NetPyNE) fire action potentials reaching **42.003 mV** (> **+20 mV** threshold)
under a 0.5 nA / 50 ms IClamp. Raw NEURON run time is **4.4 ms** wall-clock; NetPyNE run time
is **4.8 ms**. The toolchain is validated end-to-end for downstream t0008 / t0010 / t0011
tasks.

<summary><strong>How does the existing peer-reviewed literature on compartmental
models of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells structure the five
project research questions (Na/K conductances, morphology sensitivity,
AMPA/GABA balance, active vs passive dendrites, and angle-to-AP-frequency
tuning curves), and what quantitative targets does it provide?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

The literature structures the five questions around a small set of quantitative targets that
the project must hit. For Na/K conductances the Fohlmeister-Miller parameter set (peak somatic
g_Na around 0.04-0.10 S/cm^2, delayed-rectifier g_K around 0.012 S/cm^2) is the standard
starting point, and no published paper reports a factorial (g_Na, g_K) grid for DSGCs. For
morphology the asymmetric ON-OFF DSGC dendrite is sharply wired in the null direction through
SAC-mediated inhibition, yet global dendrite shape only minimally changes the synaptic map
while local electrotonic compartments still matter. For AMPA/GABA balance the canonical counts
on a reconstructed mouse DSGC are 177 AMPA and 177 GABA synapses, with null-direction
inhibition running three to five times larger than preferred inhibition. Active dendrites with
Fohlmeister-like channel densities roughly double the direction-selectivity index versus
passive trees, and the target mouse ON-OFF DSGC tuning curve should hit DSI 0.7-0.85,
preferred peak 40-80 Hz, null residual under 10 Hz, and a half-width of 60-90 degrees.

<summary><strong>What does the classical cable-theory and dendritic-computation
literature imply for the compartmental modelling of direction-selective
retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) in NEURON?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

DSGC compartmental models in NEURON must use morphologically accurate reconstructions (not
ball- and-stick), discretized with the `d_lambda` rule, and must implement direction
selectivity via postsynaptic dendritic shunting inhibition rather than presynaptic wiring
asymmetry. The DS computation must arise from asymmetric inhibitory input acting locally on
dendritic branches via the Koch-Poggio-Torre on-the-path shunting mechanism, and the model
must be validated by measuring EPSP shape-indices, losing DS under simulated inhibition block,
and reproducing the graded-vs- spike contrast-sensitivity trade-off.

<summary><strong>Which compartmental simulator should the direction-selective
ganglion cell (DSGC) project use as its primary simulator, and which should
it keep as a backup?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: high

Use NEURON 8.2.7 as the primary simulator, wrapped with NetPyNE 1.1.1 for parameter sweeps and
optimisation. Keep Arbor 0.12.0 as the backup simulator to exploit its 7-12x single-cell
speedup whenever the parameter sweep outgrows the NEURON workstation budget. Brian2 and MOOSE
are rejected because Brian2's own authors describe its multicompartment support as immature
and MOOSE shows the weakest maintenance signal of the five candidates.
