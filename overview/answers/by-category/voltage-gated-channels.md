<summary><strong>How does the existing peer-reviewed literature on compartmental
models of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells structure the five
project research questions (Na/K conductances, morphology sensitivity,
AMPA/GABA balance, active vs passive dendrites, and angle-to-AP-frequency
tuning curves), and what quantitative targets does it provide?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

The literature structures the five questions around a small set of quantitative targets that
the project must hit. For Na/K conductances the Fohlmeister-Miller parameter set (peak somatic
g_Na around 0.04-0.10 S/cm^2, delayed-rectifier g_K around 0.012 S/cm^2) is the standard
starting point, and no published paper reports a factorial (g_Na, g_K) grid for DSGCs. For
morphology the asymmetric ON-OFF DSGC dendrite is sharply wired in the null direction through
SAC-mediated inhibition, yet global dendrite shape only minimally changes the synaptic map
while local electrotonic compartments still matter. For AMPA/GABA balance the canonical counts
on a reconstructed mouse DSGC are 177 AMPA and 177 GABA synapses, with null-direction
inhibition running three to five times larger than preferred inhibition. Active dendrites with
Fohlmeister-like channel densities roughly double the direction-selectivity index versus
passive trees, and the target mouse ON-OFF DSGC tuning curve should hit DSI 0.7-0.85,
preferred peak 40-80 Hz, null residual under 10 Hz, and a half-width of 60-90 degrees.

<summary><strong>What does the patch-clamp / voltage-clamp / space-clamp literature
imply for the compartmental modelling of direction-selective retinal
ganglion cells (DSGCs) in NEURON, in particular for (a) treatment of
published Ge/Gi traces as model-fitting targets, (b) inclusion of dendritic
voltage-gated channels and the AIS compartment, (c) synaptic receptor
complement including NMDARs, and (d) modelling of maintained activity and
intrinsic pacemaker properties?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

DSGC compartmental models must treat published somatic voltage-clamp Ge/Gi traces as lower
bounds on distal dendritic conductances rather than ground truth, because up to ~80% of the
synaptic signal is lost on thin distal dendrites even in passive cables and active dendritic
channels add further error. The modelling pipeline therefore needs a simulated somatic
voltage-clamp block that mimics the experimental amplifier so simulation and experiment are
compared on the same footing. The model must include an explicit AIS compartment with Nav1.6
enrichment at approximately 7x the somatic Na+ density, with AIS length as a named tunable
parameter constrained by immunohistochemistry, and NMDARs with standard Mg2+ block kinetics on
DSGC dendrites, fit to AMPA/NMDA charge ratios during preferred and null motion rather than
peak-AMPA-current alone. Finally the modeller must decide explicitly whether to include
intrinsic-pacemaker biophysics (T-type Ca2+, HCN, subthreshold oscillations) based on the
target DSGC subtype, validated by maintained-activity-under-synaptic-blockade traces.

<summary><strong>What is the Vast.ai GPU cost and recommended organisation of a
joint DSGC morphology + top-10 voltage-gated channel DSI-maximisation
task?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

Run a surrogate-NN-assisted gradient-free evolutionary search (population 150 x 30 generations
x 3 seeds after a 5,000-sample surrogate-training burn-in, 25 free parameters = 5 Cuntz
morphology scalars + 20 channel gbar parameters) on a single RTX 4090 Vast.ai instance at a
central USD cost of about 51 dollars, with a 0.5x-2x sensitivity envelope of roughly 23-119
dollars. This combination is cheapest among the corpus-justified gradient-free strategies
because the surrogate-NN cuts 18,500 evaluations to ~8 GPU-hours of surrogate inference plus a
one-off ~83 GPU-hour CoreNEURON training burn at the RTX 4090 rate of 0.50 dollars/hour.
Confidence is medium: the CoreNEURON CPU-to-GPU speedup and the surrogate-NN economics are
external assumptions not quantified in the downloaded paper corpus, and the sensitivity grid
is propagated across a 0.5x-2x band for both per-sim cost and sample count.

<summary><strong>What quantitative priors does the voltage-gated-channels literature
supply for the DSGC compartmental model on (1) Nav subunit localisation at
the RGC AIS, (2) Kv1 subunit expression at the AIS, (3) RGC HH-family
kinetic rate functions, (4) Nav1.6 vs Nav1.2 subunit co-expression
kinetics, and (5) Nav conductance density at the AIS?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

RGC AIS Nav subunits segregate into microdomains with Nav1.6 concentrated distally and Nav1.2
enriched proximally, and Kv1.1/Kv1.2 co-localising with Nav1.6 in the distal AIS.
AIS-localised Kv1 channels activate near threshold (V_half around -40 to -50 mV) with
sub-millisecond kinetics and control AP waveform and somatic repolarisation. The
Fohlmeister-Miller RGC HH kinetics provide canonical alpha/beta rate functions for Nav and Kv
at 22 degC with Nav activation V_half near -40 mV and a Q10 near 3 for warming to 37 degC.
Nav1.6 activates about 10-15 mV more negative than Nav1.2, so distal Nav1.6 initiates the AP
while proximal Nav1.2 supports backpropagation into the soma. Peak AIS Nav conductance density
is about 2500-5000 pS/um2 (roughly 50x somatic density), an order-of-magnitude prior essential
for reproducing fast, reliable AP initiation in compartmental models.

<summary><strong>When the t0086 13-cell pool of 6 Genuine + 7 Marginal cells is

**Confidence**: medium

No -- the clusters are not mechanistically distinct. The 13-cell re-cluster produces 4
clusters (best_k = 4 by silhouette) and all 4 cluster representatives are NaP-dominant in
PD-minus-ND attribution at 16 directions (frac NaP 0.874-0.997, frac Nav1.6 0.003-0.126, frac
NMDA = 0.000). The verdict is `shared_mechanism_different_scale`: clusters differ in 54-d
parameter scale but not in which channel drives the PD response. This extends t0084's
NaP-dominant cell 767 finding to the wider 13-cell pool of joint-pass / near-joint-pass cells
in the v3 substrate.

<summary><strong>Which biophysical mechanism - NMDA Mg-block, distal Nav1.6, NaP, or
a combination - is responsible for cell 767's joint-pass DSI improvement
in the v3 Bed B substrate?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

Cell 767's PD/ND difference in integrated dendritic current is attributed primarily to **NaP
sustained depolarisation** (0.0% NMDA, 7.0% Nav1.6, 93.0% NaP) over the response window ms.
Cells 637 and 762 show the same NaP-dominant signature (98.5% and 99.9%), suggesting NaP is a
systematic feature of the v3 Pareto near-pass cluster rather than idiosyncratic to cell 767.
This single-replicate deep-dive did not reproduce cell 767's original 5-seed joint-pass DSI of
0.494 (re-evaluated DSI = 0.000), so the attribution describes the underlying biophysical
signature of these parameters rather than confirming a per-trial joint-pass mechanism;
multi-replicate confirmation requires t0083 or a follow-up multi-seed study.

<summary><strong>Why did the t0078 BoTorch qLogNEHVI MOBO collapse `nav16_ais` to
the search-space floor (1e-5 S/cm^2) at iter 81, and what biological-prior
checklist prevents this failure mode in future MOBO-on-biophysics
tasks?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: high

The optimiser exploited a soft-prior loophole. t0078's per-tier search bounds let `nav16_ais`
go as low as 1e-5 S/cm^2, four orders of magnitude below Kole 2008's measured cortical AIS Nav
range S/cm^2 and five orders below Werginz 2024's mouse alpha-RGC measurement of 1.3 S/cm^2.
Multi-objective acquisition discovered that an AIS-disabled cell could match a fragment of the
Pareto front (DSI 0.316, PD 9.68 Hz at iter 81) at a lower implicit cost than a Kole-compliant
cell, because the prior was advisory rather than enforced. The fix is hard parameter bounds,
not soft penalties: pre-register `nav16_ais >= 0.25` S/cm^2 (Kole 2008) and AIS-to-soma Nav
ratio `>= 5` (Werginz 2024) as inviolable constraints, plus equivalent priors on every
biophysical parameter where measurement-grounded ranges exist.
