<summary><strong>Does ModelDB 189347 (Poleg-Polsky and Diamond 2016) reproduce every

**Confidence**: medium

Partially. The from-scratch port of ModelDB 189347 reproduces the qualitative direction-tuning
behaviour (PD PSP > ND PSP) and the predicted suppression of selectivity under 0 Mg2+, but the
absolute PSP amplitudes are larger than the paper's reported means at the code-pinned gNMDA =
0.5 nS, and the paper-vs-code discrepancies on synapse count, gNMDA value, and noise driver
behaviour are confirmed. Ten or more discrepancies are catalogued in the full answer including
six MOD-default-vs-main.hoc-override mismatches and four pre-flagged paper-vs-code
disagreements; every Figure 1-8 reproduction outcome is recorded with numerical evidence.

<summary><strong>Does the deposited ModelDB 189347 code reproduce Poleg-Polsky
2016's Fig 3A-F per-synapse conductance balance and DSI-vs-gNMDA flatness,
and does the extended noise sweep match the paper's qualitative
shape?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

No. Every per-synapse-class summed peak conductance at the code-pinned gNMDA = 0.5 nS is 6-9x
the paper's Fig 3A-E target on the summed scale and well below it on the per-synapse-mean
scale, so neither interpretation reconciles. DSI as a function of gNMDA peaks at 0.19 near
b2gnmda = 0.5 nS and decays toward zero by 3.0 nS, never crossing the paper's claimed flat
~0.30 band. The extended noise sweep shows DSI declining qualitatively as flickerVAR rises in
the control and 0Mg conditions but the trend is weaker than the paper reports, and the ROC AUC
metric saturates at 1.0 across every cell because PSP peaks dwarf baselines on this circuit.

<summary><strong>How does the existing peer-reviewed literature on compartmental
models of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells structure the five
project research questions (Na/K conductances, morphology sensitivity,
AMPA/GABA balance, active vs passive dendrites, and angle-to-AP-frequency
tuning curves), and what quantitative targets does it provide?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

The literature structures the five questions around a small set of quantitative targets that
the project must hit. For Na/K conductances the Fohlmeister-Miller parameter set (peak somatic
g_Na around 0.04-0.10 S/cm^2, delayed-rectifier g_K around 0.012 S/cm^2) is the standard
starting point, and no published paper reports a factorial (g_Na, g_K) grid for DSGCs. For
morphology the asymmetric ON-OFF DSGC dendrite is sharply wired in the null direction through
SAC-mediated inhibition, yet global dendrite shape only minimally changes the synaptic map
while local electrotonic compartments still matter. For AMPA/GABA balance the canonical counts
on a reconstructed mouse DSGC are 177 AMPA and 177 GABA synapses, with null-direction
inhibition running three to five times larger than preferred inhibition. Active dendrites with
Fohlmeister-like channel densities roughly double the direction-selectivity index versus
passive trees, and the target mouse ON-OFF DSGC tuning curve should hit DSI 0.7-0.85,
preferred peak 40-80 Hz, null residual under 10 Hz, and a half-width of 60-90 degrees.

<summary><strong>What does the patch-clamp / voltage-clamp / space-clamp literature
imply for the compartmental modelling of direction-selective retinal
ganglion cells (DSGCs) in NEURON, in particular for (a) treatment of
published Ge/Gi traces as model-fitting targets, (b) inclusion of dendritic
voltage-gated channels and the AIS compartment, (c) synaptic receptor
complement including NMDARs, and (d) modelling of maintained activity and
intrinsic pacemaker properties?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

DSGC compartmental models must treat published somatic voltage-clamp Ge/Gi traces as lower
bounds on distal dendritic conductances rather than ground truth, because up to ~80% of the
synaptic signal is lost on thin distal dendrites even in passive cables and active dendritic
channels add further error. The modelling pipeline therefore needs a simulated somatic
voltage-clamp block that mimics the experimental amplifier so simulation and experiment are
compared on the same footing. The model must include an explicit AIS compartment with Nav1.6
enrichment at approximately 7x the somatic Na+ density, with AIS length as a named tunable
parameter constrained by immunohistochemistry, and NMDARs with standard Mg2+ block kinetics on
DSGC dendrites, fit to AMPA/NMDA charge ratios during preferred and null motion rather than
peak-AMPA-current alone. Finally the modeller must decide explicitly whether to include
intrinsic-pacemaker biophysics (T-type Ca2+, HCN, subthreshold oscillations) based on the
target DSGC subtype, validated by maintained-activity-under-synaptic-blockade traces.

<summary><strong>What quantitative priors does the synaptic-integration literature
supply for the DSGC compartmental model on (1) AMPA/NMDA/GABA receptor
kinetics, (2) shunting inhibition, (3) E-I balance temporal co-tuning, (4)
dendritic-location-dependent PSP integration, and (5) SAC-to-DSGC
inhibitory asymmetry?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

Receptor kinetics: AMPA uses a fast bi-exponential conductance (rise ~0.2 ms, decay ~1-3 ms,
Erev 0 mV); NMDA uses a slow conductance (rise ~5-10 ms, decay ~50-100 ms, Erev 0 mV) with
Jahr-Stevens Mg2+ block; GABA_A uses a fast bi-exponential (rise ~0.5 ms, decay ~5-10 ms, Erev
-65 to -75 mV). Shunting inhibition vetoes excitation multiplicatively with an "on-the-path"
geometry: only inhibition sitting between the excitatory input and the soma shunts PSP
amplitude, while distal inhibition has negligible effect. Excitation and inhibition co-tune in
time with inhibition lagging excitation by ~1-3 ms in cortex and ~15-50 ms in DSGCs during
null-direction motion, sharpening spike timing. Somatic PSP amplitude decays roughly
exponentially with electrotonic distance (lambda_DC ~100-300 um for RGC dendrites) while local
dendritic non-linearities (Na+, Ca2+, NMDAR) partially compensate for distal attenuation. SAC
boutons onto a DSGC dendrite are spatially asymmetric with stronger inhibition from null-side
SACs, and this cellular asymmetry (not somatic E-I timing alone) is the primary substrate for
direction selectivity at the DSGC level.

<summary><strong>What variables of neuronal morphology have been shown by
computational modeling to affect direction selectivity, by what mechanisms,
and what gaps remain?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

Computational models have shown that direction selectivity is shaped by dendritic length,
branch-order and branching pattern, dendritic diameter (especially in starburst amacrine
cells), spatial layout and kinetic tiling of bipolar-cell inputs, asymmetric arbors and plexus
density, and the electrotonic compartmentalization of terminal branches. The load-bearing
mechanisms are passive cable filtering with transfer-resistance weighting of distributed
inputs, local-global EPSP summation along soma-to-tip dendritic gradients, space-time input
tiling (sustained proximal, transient distal), dendritic-spike branch independence driven by
voltage-gated Na and Ca channels, and asymmetric SAC-to-DSGC inhibition constrained by
morphology. Gaps remain in systematic sweeps of branch order and dendritic diameter on
realistic reconstructions, in joint manipulation of morphology with active conductances at
DSGC tips, and in morphology-aware modeling of cortical and invertebrate direction selectivity
beyond the retina.

<summary><strong>Which dendritic-computation motifs observed in cortical,
hippocampal, and cerebellar neurons plausibly transfer to DSGC dendrites,
and what are the biophysical caveats?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

Three dendritic-computation motifs plausibly transfer from pyramidal, hippocampal, and
cerebellar dendrites to DSGC dendrites: NMDA-receptor-mediated on-branch supralinear
integration, asymmetric shunting inhibition placed on the path between excitation and soma,
and sublinear-to-supralinear regime switching driven by clustered input. Ca2+-plateau BAC
firing and behavioral-timescale plasticity transfer less cleanly because DSGC dendrites are
short and unipolar rather than tufted. All transferred numbers must be treated as targets to
falsify rather than to assume, pending DSGC-specific patch validation.
