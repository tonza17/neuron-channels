<summary><strong>What does the classical cable-theory and dendritic-computation
literature imply for the compartmental modelling of direction-selective
retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) in NEURON?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

DSGC compartmental models in NEURON must use morphologically accurate reconstructions (not
ball- and-stick), discretized with the `d_lambda` rule, and must implement direction
selectivity via postsynaptic dendritic shunting inhibition rather than presynaptic wiring
asymmetry. The DS computation must arise from asymmetric inhibitory input acting locally on
dendritic branches via the Koch-Poggio-Torre on-the-path shunting mechanism, and the model
must be validated by measuring EPSP shape-indices, losing DS under simulated inhibition block,
and reproducing the graded-vs- spike contrast-sensitivity trade-off.
