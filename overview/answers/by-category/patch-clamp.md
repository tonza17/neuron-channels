<summary><strong>What does the patch-clamp / voltage-clamp / space-clamp literature
imply for the compartmental modelling of direction-selective retinal
ganglion cells (DSGCs) in NEURON, in particular for (a) treatment of
published Ge/Gi traces as model-fitting targets, (b) inclusion of dendritic
voltage-gated channels and the AIS compartment, (c) synaptic receptor
complement including NMDARs, and (d) modelling of maintained activity and
intrinsic pacemaker properties?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

DSGC compartmental models must treat published somatic voltage-clamp Ge/Gi traces as lower
bounds on distal dendritic conductances rather than ground truth, because up to ~80% of the
synaptic signal is lost on thin distal dendrites even in passive cables and active dendritic
channels add further error. The modelling pipeline therefore needs a simulated somatic
voltage-clamp block that mimics the experimental amplifier so simulation and experiment are
compared on the same footing. The model must include an explicit AIS compartment with Nav1.6
enrichment at approximately 7x the somatic Na+ density, with AIS length as a named tunable
parameter constrained by immunohistochemistry, and NMDARs with standard Mg2+ block kinetics on
DSGC dendrites, fit to AMPA/NMDA charge ratios during preferred and null motion rather than
peak-AMPA-current alone. Finally the modeller must decide explicitly whether to include
intrinsic-pacemaker biophysics (T-type Ca2+, HCN, subthreshold oscillations) based on the
target DSGC subtype, validated by maintained-activity-under-synaptic-blockade traces.

<summary><strong>What quantitative priors does the voltage-gated-channels literature
supply for the DSGC compartmental model on (1) Nav subunit localisation at
the RGC AIS, (2) Kv1 subunit expression at the AIS, (3) RGC HH-family
kinetic rate functions, (4) Nav1.6 vs Nav1.2 subunit co-expression
kinetics, and (5) Nav conductance density at the AIS?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

RGC AIS Nav subunits segregate into microdomains with Nav1.6 concentrated distally and Nav1.2
enriched proximally, and Kv1.1/Kv1.2 co-localising with Nav1.6 in the distal AIS.
AIS-localised Kv1 channels activate near threshold (V_half around -40 to -50 mV) with
sub-millisecond kinetics and control AP waveform and somatic repolarisation. The
Fohlmeister-Miller RGC HH kinetics provide canonical alpha/beta rate functions for Nav and Kv
at 22 degC with Nav activation V_half near -40 mV and a Q10 near 3 for warming to 37 degC.
Nav1.6 activates about 10-15 mV more negative than Nav1.2, so distal Nav1.6 initiates the AP
while proximal Nav1.2 supports backpropagation into the soma. Peak AIS Nav conductance density
is about 2500-5000 pS/um2 (roughly 50x somatic density), an order-of-magnitude prior essential
for reproducing fast, reliable AP initiation in compartmental models.

<summary><strong>Why did the t0078 BoTorch qLogNEHVI MOBO collapse `nav16_ais` to
the search-space floor (1e-5 S/cm^2) at iter 81, and what biological-prior
checklist prevents this failure mode in future MOBO-on-biophysics
tasks?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: high

The optimiser exploited a soft-prior loophole. t0078's per-tier search bounds let `nav16_ais`
go as low as 1e-5 S/cm^2, four orders of magnitude below Kole 2008's measured cortical AIS Nav
range S/cm^2 and five orders below Werginz 2024's mouse alpha-RGC measurement of 1.3 S/cm^2.
Multi-objective acquisition discovered that an AIS-disabled cell could match a fragment of the
Pareto front (DSI 0.316, PD 9.68 Hz at iter 81) at a lower implicit cost than a Kole-compliant
cell, because the prior was advisory rather than enforced. The fix is hard parameter bounds,
not soft penalties: pre-register `nav16_ais >= 0.25` S/cm^2 (Kole 2008) and AIS-to-soma Nav
ratio `>= 5` (Werginz 2024) as inviolable constraints, plus equivalent priors on every
biophysical parameter where measurement-grounded ranges exist.
