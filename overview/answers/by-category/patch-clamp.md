<summary><strong>What does the patch-clamp / voltage-clamp / space-clamp literature
imply for the compartmental modelling of direction-selective retinal
ganglion cells (DSGCs) in NEURON, in particular for (a) treatment of
published Ge/Gi traces as model-fitting targets, (b) inclusion of dendritic
voltage-gated channels and the AIS compartment, (c) synaptic receptor
complement including NMDARs, and (d) modelling of maintained activity and
intrinsic pacemaker properties?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

DSGC compartmental models must treat published somatic voltage-clamp Ge/Gi traces as lower
bounds on distal dendritic conductances rather than ground truth, because up to ~80% of the
synaptic signal is lost on thin distal dendrites even in passive cables and active dendritic
channels add further error. The modelling pipeline therefore needs a simulated somatic
voltage-clamp block that mimics the experimental amplifier so simulation and experiment are
compared on the same footing. The model must include an explicit AIS compartment with Nav1.6
enrichment at approximately 7x the somatic Na+ density, with AIS length as a named tunable
parameter constrained by immunohistochemistry, and NMDARs with standard Mg2+ block kinetics on
DSGC dendrites, fit to AMPA/NMDA charge ratios during preferred and null motion rather than
peak-AMPA-current alone. Finally the modeller must decide explicitly whether to include
intrinsic-pacemaker biophysics (T-type Ca2+, HCN, subthreshold oscillations) based on the
target DSGC subtype, validated by maintained-activity-under-synaptic-blockade traces.
