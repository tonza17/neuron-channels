<summary><strong>Can ModelDB 189347 (Poleg-Polsky & Diamond 2016 ON-OFF DRD4 DSGC)
be reproduced locally on Windows as a headless library, does it hit the
published direction-selectivity envelope with a canonical 12-angle x
20-trial drifting-bar protocol, and which sibling DSGC compartmental models
are the next-best candidates for porting in the same pipeline?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

Yes, ModelDB 189347 was ported and runs headless on Windows 11 with NEURON 8.2.7 via a Python
driver that sources the verbatim HOC and MOD files through `h.load_file`/`h.nrn_load_dll`; a
12-angle x 20-trial sweep on the bundled morphology completed end-to-end in roughly 10 minutes
and the four registered metrics (DSI, HWHM, reliability, RMSE vs target) were written to
`results/metrics.json`. The tuning curve does not hit the published envelope at the bundled
parameters (peak well below 40 Hz, DSI well below 0.7), because the paper derives DS from a
`gabaMOD` parameter swap rather than from spatial rotation — the port's rotation-based
protocol is only a proxy for a direction- selective stimulus. The Hanson et al. 2019
Spatial-Offset-DSGC model (GitHub `geoffder/Spatial-Offset-DSGC-NEURON-Model`) is the
next-best port candidate: it shares `RGCmodel.hoc` and `HHst.mod` with 189347 and already
ships a Python driver; Jain 2020 is medium-effort; Ding 2016, Schachter 2010, Koren 2017, and
Ezra-Tsur 2022 either lack a public compartmental model or address a different modelling
class.

<summary><strong>How does the existing peer-reviewed literature on compartmental
models of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells structure the five
project research questions (Na/K conductances, morphology sensitivity,
AMPA/GABA balance, active vs passive dendrites, and angle-to-AP-frequency
tuning curves), and what quantitative targets does it provide?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

The literature structures the five questions around a small set of quantitative targets that
the project must hit. For Na/K conductances the Fohlmeister-Miller parameter set (peak somatic
g_Na around 0.04-0.10 S/cm^2, delayed-rectifier g_K around 0.012 S/cm^2) is the standard
starting point, and no published paper reports a factorial (g_Na, g_K) grid for DSGCs. For
morphology the asymmetric ON-OFF DSGC dendrite is sharply wired in the null direction through
SAC-mediated inhibition, yet global dendrite shape only minimally changes the synaptic map
while local electrotonic compartments still matter. For AMPA/GABA balance the canonical counts
on a reconstructed mouse DSGC are 177 AMPA and 177 GABA synapses, with null-direction
inhibition running three to five times larger than preferred inhibition. Active dendrites with
Fohlmeister-like channel densities roughly double the direction-selectivity index versus
passive trees, and the target mouse ON-OFF DSGC tuning curve should hit DSI 0.7-0.85,
preferred peak 40-80 Hz, null residual under 10 Hz, and a half-width of 60-90 degrees.

<summary><strong>What does the patch-clamp / voltage-clamp / space-clamp literature
imply for the compartmental modelling of direction-selective retinal
ganglion cells (DSGCs) in NEURON, in particular for (a) treatment of
published Ge/Gi traces as model-fitting targets, (b) inclusion of dendritic
voltage-gated channels and the AIS compartment, (c) synaptic receptor
complement including NMDARs, and (d) modelling of maintained activity and
intrinsic pacemaker properties?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

DSGC compartmental models must treat published somatic voltage-clamp Ge/Gi traces as lower
bounds on distal dendritic conductances rather than ground truth, because up to ~80% of the
synaptic signal is lost on thin distal dendrites even in passive cables and active dendritic
channels add further error. The modelling pipeline therefore needs a simulated somatic
voltage-clamp block that mimics the experimental amplifier so simulation and experiment are
compared on the same footing. The model must include an explicit AIS compartment with Nav1.6
enrichment at approximately 7x the somatic Na+ density, with AIS length as a named tunable
parameter constrained by immunohistochemistry, and NMDARs with standard Mg2+ block kinetics on
DSGC dendrites, fit to AMPA/NMDA charge ratios during preferred and null motion rather than
peak-AMPA-current alone. Finally the modeller must decide explicitly whether to include
intrinsic-pacemaker biophysics (T-type Ca2+, HCN, subthreshold oscillations) based on the
target DSGC subtype, validated by maintained-activity-under-synaptic-blockade traces.

<summary><strong>What quantitative priors does the synaptic-integration literature
supply for the DSGC compartmental model on (1) AMPA/NMDA/GABA receptor
kinetics, (2) shunting inhibition, (3) E-I balance temporal co-tuning, (4)
dendritic-location-dependent PSP integration, and (5) SAC-to-DSGC
inhibitory asymmetry?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: medium

Receptor kinetics: AMPA uses a fast bi-exponential conductance (rise ~0.2 ms, decay ~1-3 ms,
Erev 0 mV); NMDA uses a slow conductance (rise ~5-10 ms, decay ~50-100 ms, Erev 0 mV) with
Jahr-Stevens Mg2+ block; GABA_A uses a fast bi-exponential (rise ~0.5 ms, decay ~5-10 ms, Erev
-65 to -75 mV). Shunting inhibition vetoes excitation multiplicatively with an "on-the-path"
geometry: only inhibition sitting between the excitatory input and the soma shunts PSP
amplitude, while distal inhibition has negligible effect. Excitation and inhibition co-tune in
time with inhibition lagging excitation by ~1-3 ms in cortex and ~15-50 ms in DSGCs during
null-direction motion, sharpening spike timing. Somatic PSP amplitude decays roughly
exponentially with electrotonic distance (lambda_DC ~100-300 um for RGC dendrites) while local
dendritic non-linearities (Na+, Ca2+, NMDAR) partially compensate for distal attenuation. SAC
boutons onto a DSGC dendrite are spatially asymmetric with stronger inhibition from null-side
SACs, and this cellular asymmetry (not somatic E-I timing alone) is the primary substrate for
direction selectivity at the DSGC level.

<summary><strong>Which compartmental simulator should the direction-selective
ganglion cell (DSGC) project use as its primary simulator, and which should
it keep as a backup?</strong></summary>

**Confidence**: high

Use NEURON 8.2.7 as the primary simulator, wrapped with NetPyNE 1.1.1 for parameter sweeps and
optimisation. Keep Arbor 0.12.0 as the backup simulator to exploit its 7-12x single-cell
speedup whenever the parameter sweep outgrows the NEURON workstation budget. Brian2 and MOOSE
are rejected because Brian2's own authors describe its multicompartment support as immature
and MOOSE shows the weakest maintenance signal of the five candidates.
