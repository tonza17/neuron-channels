Branco, Clark, and Häusser ask whether individual cortical dendrites can detect the temporal
order of their synaptic inputs — a computation previously assumed to require networks of
neurons. Using multi-site two-photon glutamate uncaging in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of rat
somatosensory and visual cortex, they show that single dendrites produce systematically larger
somatic EPSPs and higher spike probabilities when synapses are activated from the branch tip
toward the soma ("IN") than from soma to tip ("OUT"), and that local dendritic Ca2+ signals
carry the same directionality. The finding scales up: neurons can also discriminate arbitrary
random temporal sequences delivered to a single dendrite or distributed across multiple
dendrites.

The mechanism is revealed by pharmacology and a compartmental model. Blocking NMDA receptors
with D-AP5 abolishes supralinear summation (response drops from **223 ± 9%** to **103 ± 3%**
of linear sum) and the directional asymmetry (IN-OUT difference shrinks from **2.8 mV** to
**0.4 mV**). The compartmental model with passive dendrites and AMPA+NMDA synapses fully
reproduces direction sensitivity, identifying the mechanism as the interaction between the
dendritic impedance gradient (high distally, low proximally) and the voltage-dependent Mg2+
block of NMDA receptors. Sequences initiated distally depolarise more locally, progressively
relieving Mg2+ block and generating a regenerative NMDAR cascade that is absent in the
distal-to-proximal direction.

The paper's headline results are: IN responses **31 ± 4%** larger than OUT (n = 20); spike
probability **38 ± 9%** higher; Ca2+ signals **48 ± 13%** larger; random pattern
discrimination probability **40%** (> 1 mV, n = 7); multi-dendrite sequence discrimination
**4.0 ± 1.3 mV** (n = 5). All effects are abolished by D-AP5 or hyperpolarisation. The
mechanism is confirmed in layer 5 pyramidal neurons and hippocampal dentate gyrus granule
cells.

For this project, Branco et al. (2010) provides the mechanistic logic for dendritic direction
selectivity in the compartmental model: the impedance gradient combined with NMDA receptor
non-linearity converts a spatiotemporal sweep of synaptic activation into a directionally
tuned output. Although the paper uses cortical pyramidal neurons, the mechanism explicitly
generalises to any neuron with an impedance gradient and NMDAR-containing synapses, including
DSGCs. The ModelDB 140828 NEURON implementation offers directly reusable AMPA+NMDA synapse
code, the ~2–3 µm/ms optimal velocity sets a wave-sweep parameter target, and the D-AP5
results provide a clear internal control for validating the synaptic component of the DSGC
model.

of Motion in a Simulation of the Direction-Selective Ganglion Cell</strong>

Schachter, Oesch, Smith & Taylor (2010) ask how the rabbit On-Off direction-selective ganglion
cell converts weakly directionally tuned synaptic input (PSP DSI ~0.2) into strongly tuned
spike output (spike DSI ~0.8). The scope is a single-cell biophysical explanation: given the
known circuitry (starburst amacrine cells providing presynaptic DS, spatially offset
postsynaptic inhibition) and the known cell (anatomical DSGC morphology with active
dendrites), can the measured transformation be reproduced, and what is each mechanism
contribution? This is motivated by prior in vitro evidence from Oesch et al. (2005) that each
somatic spike is triggered by a dendritic spike, and by the unresolved question of whether
postsynaptic inhibition alone can account for DS.

The methodology is a NeuronC compartmental simulation of a reconstructed DSGC with
Hodgkin-Huxley Na, Kv, Kv4, and Ca channels in the dendrites and soma, driven by AMPA-like
excitatory and GABA-A-like inhibitory synapses whose conductances and timings match published
voltage-clamp data. Stimulation protocols include single-synapse threshold mapping, paired
excitation+inhibition titration, and full 12-direction drifting-bar experiments. Key design
decisions include electrically compartmentalizing the dendrites via high Rm and thin distal
branches (Rin >1 GOhm), using uniform or graded dendritic gNa (**40 mS/cm^2** or **45 to 20
mS/cm^2**), and systematically removing each DS mechanism to isolate its contribution.

The headline results are that local dendritic spike thresholds act as ~4x nonlinear amplifiers
of PSP-level DS; that physiological inhibition (**~4-10 nS**) can prevent spike initiation but
cannot block propagation (which would require ~85 nS); that presynaptic DS from SACs is the
more robust mechanism across the arbor while postsynaptic inhibition dominates only at distal
tips; and that an intrinsic dendritic geometric effect actually opposes the desired DS on the
preferred side, requiring network DS to be strong enough to overcome it. Somatic voltage-clamp
additionally underestimates distal conductances by 40-100%.

For the present project compartmental modeling of DSGCs, this paper provides a concrete
reference design (channel densities, synapse conductances, inhibition placement, morphology
source) and three load-bearing predictions to reproduce: (i) the 4x amplification of DSI from
PSPs to spikes via dendritic Na, (ii) the initiation-vs-propagation asymmetry for inhibition,
and (iii) the compartmentalized-subunit structure of the tree. It also establishes that
presynaptic DS cannot be omitted from a DSGC model intended to match physiological spike
tuning and gives quantitative guidance on how to calibrate voltage-clamp-derived conductances
for use in simulation.

This paper describes the NEURON simulation environment, a domain-specific software system for
building biophysically detailed compartmental models of individual neurons and small networks.
It motivates the work by the inadequacy of generic ODE solvers for problems with branched
cable geometry, multiple voltage- and ligand-gated ionic currents, and spatially nonuniform
membrane potential. The scope is deliberately broad — from single-compartment HH models
through reconstructed dendritic trees with thousands of compartments — and the paper positions
NEURON as the tool that lets modelers focus on biophysics rather than on numerics.

Methodologically, NEURON rests on four design choices: (1) a two-level data model separating
anatomical `sections` from numerical `segments`; (2) an O(N) Gaussian elimination for the
branched cable matrix; (3) a staggered-time-step second-order integration scheme that is as
cheap per step as backward Euler; and (4) NMODL, a DSL for specifying membrane mechanisms that
is translated to C and dynamically linked into the simulator. The top-level interface is the
hoc interpreter with an InterViews-based GUI for interactive debugging.

The headline results are qualitative — the paper shows that the combined system can simulate
morphologically reconstructed neurons with detailed ion-channel biophysics at usable
wall-clock speeds on 1990s hardware, and that adding new channel types requires only an NMODL
file. The O(N) solver and the staggered Crank-Nicolson integrator are each presented with
mathematical justification and are the numerical innovations that make the system performant.
No quantitative benchmark table is given, but subsequent decades of published models establish
that the framework achieves its design goals.

For this project's literature survey on compartmental DSGC (direction-selective ganglion cell)
models, this paper is foundational infrastructure rather than a direct scientific antecedent.
Virtually every compartmental DSGC model in the literature is written against the abstractions
introduced here — sections, segments, NMODL mechanisms, hoc scripts. Understanding the
section/segment distinction, the role of `nseg`, and the NMODL toolchain is a prerequisite for
reading, replicating, and critiquing those models. The paper also defines the numerical
methods whose accuracy limits (first-order backward Euler, fixed-timestep analytical gating
updates) set the floor for how faithfully any DSGC compartmental model can reproduce fast
dendritic transients.

<summary>🔧 <strong>Calibrate realistic dendritic diameters for
dsgc-baseline-morphology to replace the 0.125 um placeholder radii</strong>
(S-0005-02)</summary>

**Kind**: technique | **Priority**: high | **Date**: 2026-04-19 | **Source**:
[t0005_download_dsgc_morphology](../../tasks/t0005_download_dsgc_morphology/)

Every compartment in the downloaded CNG SWC carries the placeholder radius 0.125 um because
the original Simple Neurite Tracer reconstruction did not record diameters. Cable-theory
predicts segment diameter is the single most influential local-electrotonic knob (see
S-0002-04), so leaving the uniform placeholder in place will silently bias every downstream
biophysical simulation (axial resistance, attenuation, spike initiation threshold). Build a
diameter-calibration pipeline that applies a literature-derived order-dependent diameter taper
(e.g., Vaney/Sivyer/Taylor 2012 mouse ON-OFF DSGC profile, or the Poleg-Polsky 2016
distribution) keyed on Strahler order or path distance from the soma, write the calibrated SWC
as a new dataset asset (e.g., dsgc-baseline-morphology-calibrated), and report the per-order
diameter distribution against the original placeholder. Recommended task types:
feature-engineering, data-analysis.
