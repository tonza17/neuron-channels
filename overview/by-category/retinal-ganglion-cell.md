<summary>📝 <strong>Retinal waves shape starburst amacrine cell dendrite development
through a direction-selective dendritic computation</strong> — Pitcher

Pitcher et al. ask whether spontaneous retinal waves can instruct dendritic morphology through
a local dendritic computation, using developing mouse SACs as a model. The work spans calcium
imaging in P7-P13 retina, pharmacological dissection with TEA, two genetic models (b2-nAChR-KO
for activity loss, FRMD7tm for loss of wave propagation bias), and 3D dendrite reconstructions
across the same ages.

The methodology combines two-photon imaging of GCaMP-loaded single SAC dendrites with
quadrant-resolved DSI metrics for moving bars and propagating waves, plus reconstruction-based
quantification of nasal-vs-temporal dendrite length and distal complexity. The experimental
design is elegant: it shows that the dendritic computation is present (P10 imaging), that it
depends on K+-channel-based compartmentalisation (TEA experiment), that activity is required
for outgrowth (b2-nAChR-KO), and that wave *direction*, not just wave existence, is required
for the morphological asymmetry (FRMD7tm).

The headline finding is that SAC dendrites at P9-P11 exhibit centrifugal-preferred direction
selectivity to retinal waves; that dendritic tuning rises with distance from the soma; that
TEA abolishes this tuning; and that wild-type SACs have nasal dendrites longer than temporal
dendrites (a difference absent when wave propagation bias is removed). Together these results
identify SACs as the earliest known cellular decoder of retinal-wave propagation bias and link
that decoding to a structural morphological asymmetry that persists into the adult
direction-selective circuit.

For this project the paper is upstream context, not a direct input. t0080 (Bed B v3) treats
the SAC drive onto the DSGC as a fixed, idealised null-side inhibitory waveform; it does not
model SAC morphology development. Pitcher 2026 is therefore relevant only as developmental
background for *why* the SAC inhibitory drive has its asymmetric form in the mature retina,
and as a flagged source of biological asymmetry that future tasks could optionally model if
the inhibitory machinery onto the DSGC is ever brought back into the optimisation.

Poleg-Polsky uses a machine-learning parameter search over a 352-segment biophysical model of
a mouse ON-OFF DSGC to enumerate mechanisms that can produce direction selectivity. The search
space includes bipolar-cell input geometry, synaptic kinetics, NMDA receptor placement and
strength, dendritic voltage-gated channel densities, and the presence or absence of
SAC-derived inhibition. Thousands of candidate configurations are simulated under standardised
moving-bar stimuli and scored on DSI.

The search reveals that many qualitatively different mechanisms can produce robust direction
selectivity. Dendrite-intrinsic primitives - velocity-dependent coincidence detection,
distance-graded passive delay lines, NMDA-mediated multiplicative gating - are each sufficient
on their own. Hybrid configurations that combine these primitives with SAC-derived inhibition
match experimental DSI most closely. Targeted ablations confirm each primitive is causally
responsible for DSI within its cluster.

The paper challenges the textbook view that starburst amacrine cells are the dominant
substrate of DSGC direction selectivity. Instead, it argues the DSGC dendrite itself is a
richer computational organ capable of producing DS via multiple biophysically plausible
strategies, and that the retinal circuit likely exploits several of them in parallel.

For t0010_hunt_missed_dsgc_models, this paper is a high-priority candidate. The companion code
(`PolegPolskyLab/DS-mechanisms`) provides a NEURON + Python 352-segment DSGC model exposing
exactly the parameters our project is interested in probing - bipolar-cell input structure,
kinetics, NMDA strength, and dendritic biophysics. The ML-discovered configurations give us a
library of distinct tuning-curve shapes to include in comparative analyses. The primary
porting risk is the absent LICENSE file; a licence clarification intervention or
fork-under-MIT may be required before the code can be redistributed.

This paper addresses how starburst amacrine cells shape direction selectivity in ON-OFF DSGCs
at the subcellular scale, focusing on the differential release of GABA and ACh. The authors
combine two-photon Ca2+ imaging of local DSGC dendritic subunits with a biophysically detailed
NEURON network model that explicitly represents the anatomical offset between SAC-GABA and
SAC-ACh synapses onto the DSGC.

Using acetylcholinesterase blockade, they perturb ACh dynamics while preserving the global
excitation/inhibition balance across the dendritic tree. Experimentally, this preserves
cell-wide firing but degrades direction selectivity at the local subunit level. The network
model reproduces the dissociation and attributes it to local uncoupling of E and I caused by
spatiotemporal perturbation of ACh relative to spatially offset GABA.

The central finding is that direction-selective computation in a DSGC is not a simple function
of whole-cell E/I balance, but depends on a *microstructured* alignment of GABA and ACh
release from SACs. Perturbing this alignment - even without disturbing the global ratio - is
sufficient to compromise the cell direction selectivity at the subunit scale. The authors call
this the "hidden" synaptic microarchitecture of the DS circuit.

For the current project (t0010_hunt_missed_dsgc_models), the paper is a top-priority
candidate: it publishes a new MIT-licensed NEURON + Python DSGC network model with
differential GABA/ACh wiring, directly addresses the project research question of how local
synaptic input patterns determine DSGC tuning, and extends the canonical Poleg-Polsky 2016
model already ported by t0008. The companion repository
(`geoffder/ds-circuit-ei-microarchitecture`, Zenodo 10.5281/zenodo.17666157) ships a driver
script, MOD files, and a HOC geometry that should be amenable to an automated port with a thin
12-direction tuning-curve wrapper. The main limitation for this summary is that the published
PDF could not be downloaded (Elsevier 403), so all quantitative values above that are not
cited from the abstract should be re-verified once a human reviewer retrieves the article
manually.

Budoff and Poleg-Polsky (2025) present the first complete spatial atlas of all 45 mouse
retinal ganglion cell subtypes. The motivation is direct: scRNA-seq has catalogued ~45 mouse
RGC subtypes, but spatial mapping had reached only about 17 of them, leaving most of the
population's retinal topography and any regional specialization unknown. The study asks where
each genetically defined subtype lives, whether subtypes show local mosaic regularity, whether
gene expression varies within a subtype as a function of retinal position, and how the mouse
area retinae temporalis (ART) compares transcriptomically to the primate macula.

Methodologically the paper combines four pieces: (1) en-face cryosectioning of intact
ganglion-cell layers on 10X Genomics Xenium slides, (2) a custom 300-gene Xenium panel chosen
by the GraSP neural-network-ensemble feature selector (225 unbiased genes plus 75 manually
picked synaptic-protein and voltage-gated-channel genes), (3) Baysor Bayesian cell
segmentation with Xenium nuclear priors, and (4) CuttleNet, a two-stage hierarchical deep
neural network with a class "head" and dynamically routed subtype "tentacles" trained on
integrated mouse scRNA-seq atlases. Five C57BL/6J retinas were imaged, IHC-stained with RBPMS
and tomato lectin, and projected onto a normalized Cartesian retina aligned by the Opn1sw/mw
opsin gradient. Local mosaicism was assessed with VDRI/NNRI/effective-radius statistics
against bootstrap nulls; global clustering used Moran's I plus Kulldorff scan statistics and
F1 overlap with ethologically relevant visual-field masks; DEGs were tested by ANOVA with
multiple-comparison correction.

The atlas reveals that about two-thirds of mouse RGC subtypes (29 of 45) tile the retina
nearly uniformly, with the remaining third splitting into a ventral, sky-facing group and a
dorso-temporal, ART-preferring group containing the α-RGC family and several intrinsically
photosensitive RGC subtypes. Local mosaic regularity was confirmed for 18 of 26 well-sampled
subtypes. Most known maps (αONS, αONT, αOFFS, W3, J-RGCs, M1/M2/M4/M5 ipRGCs) were reproduced,
with the only material disagreement being a modest ventral-temporal peak for αOFFT (T45)
instead of the previously reported uniform distribution. About 0.9% of gene x subtype
combinations showed within-subtype regional DEGs, mostly along the sky-vs-ground axis; T6, T8,
T14, T16, T17, and T36 carried the most DEGs. The mouse ART correlates weakly with the primate
macula transcriptomically: voltage-gated sodium channel expression is positively correlated
(driven by ventral Group-3 subtypes), while GABA and glycine receptors are anti-correlated.

For this project, the paper provides three concrete deliverables. First, it pins the
dorso-temporal location of the α-RGC family that is mechanistically closest to ON-OFF DSGCs,
fixing the regional context in which the project's single-cell DSGC model lives. Second, the
demonstration that voltage-gated sodium channel and GABA receptor gene expression varies
within a subtype as a function of retinal position gives direct biological support to the
project's core premise that systematic parametric exploration of Na/K conductance combinations
is biologically realistic -- a single DSGC subtype is not a single biophysical operating
point. Third, the divergence between the mouse ART and primate macula (especially for
GABA/glycine receptors) warns against over-extrapolating any optimised mouse-DSGC model to
primate central vision. This paper also confirms the Poleg-Polsky group's continued activity
on mouse DSGC biology, which is relevant context for the de Rosenroll 2026 DSGC model that
motivates this task.

Riccitelli et al. ask whether direction selectivity in the mouse retina is restricted to the
canonical direction-selective ganglion cells, or whether it is also computed at the population
level by RGCs through the so-called extraclassical receptive field. They tackle this with
large-scale ex vivo MEA recordings of dorsal mouse retinas plus complementary in vivo
Neuropixels recordings in the LGN, and supplement the recordings with static-bar mapping,
central-area occlusion masks, multiple bar speeds, glycinergic-amacrine pharmacology, and
gap-junction pharmacology.

Their methodology centres on a 350 um radius Central area mask that defines the classical RF
boundary and a Distancemin filter (450 um to retinal edge) that ensures every cell has a
measurable extraclassical annulus. Two motion-asymmetry metrics (mAI > 0.3, NVS > 0.15) plus
permutation shuffling identify the asymmetric PRE response. Static flashed bars locate the
asymmetric activation zone; centre masking dissociates desensitization from an inherent DS
component; strychnine and MFA reveal a wide-field-amacrine plus glycinergic plus gap-junction
circuit; multi-speed bars demonstrate speed invariance.

The headline findings are that **12.7%** of mouse RGCs (and a corresponding subset of LGN
neurons) encode motion direction outside their classical RF through an asymmetric activation
zone, that their preferred directions form a centripetal population code pointing toward the
optic disc, that direction tuning relies jointly on classical-RF desensitization and on an
inherent DS component inside the activation zone, and that glycinergic amacrine cells plus
gap-junction coupling are necessary for the full effect. The signal survives to dLGN, vLGN,
and IGL.

For this project, the paper is broader population-coding context rather than a direct model
target. The neuron-channels project simulates an explicitly direction-selective DRD4 ON-OFF
DSGC in NEURON, so Riccitelli et al. occupy a complementary niche; they describe DS
computations in non-DS RGCs that arise from circuit-level interactions outside any single
cell. The paper is relevant for framing the t0080 v3 substrate (single-DSGC model) within the
wider population-level direction-encoding literature, for noting that the 5-fold
AIS-Nav-density scaling debate concerns DRD4 DSGCs specifically rather than the broader RGC
population, and as a Zenodo data source if a later task ever needs out-of-DSGC RGC firing
benchmarks. It does not change the t0080 NSGA-II parameter bounds, the dendritic-spike
conductance ranges, or the AHP-tail metrics, but it strengthens the rationale for the project
narrow focus on the DRD4 cell type rather than generalising claims to RGC direction encoding
as a whole.

Ankri, Riccitelli, and Rivlin-Etzion examine how prolonged photopic illumination reshapes the
receptive field and directional code of posterior-preferring On-Off direction-selective
ganglion cells (pDSGCs) in mouse retina. The standard textbook view, including the authors'
own prior work, attributes retinal direction selectivity to asymmetric inhibition from
starburst amacrine cells, with directional excitation either absent or attributed to
space-clamp artefact. The authors set out to test whether luminance-state changes that are
known to remodel centre-surround antagonism (Ankri 2020, Farrow 2013, Nath 2023) also
reorganise the directional code itself.

Methodologically the study combines two-photon-targeted loose-patch and whole-cell
voltage-clamp recordings from genetically labelled pDSGCs (Drd4-EGFP and Trhr-EGFP mice) with
252-electrode MEA recordings from wild-type retinas. Direction tuning is probed with 1 mm bars
that traverse the centre and surround sequentially, and receptive-field structure with
concentric spot stimuli. Two adaptation protocols are used (3-5.5 min of stationary photopic
light, or repetitive visual stimulation with drifting gratings). Pharmacology with SR95531,
strychnine, and L-AP4 dissects the GABAergic, glycinergic, and On-pathway contributions to the
unmasked surround excitation.

Light adaptation expands the pDSGC receptive field asymmetrically toward the preferred side
(asymmetry index On = **0.44** vs. Off = **0.15**), more than doubles the On spike-response
duration (**305 +/- 255 ms** -> **779 +/- 149 ms**, *P* = **1.96e-4**), and adds a delayed
null-direction-tuned spiking phase to the cell's normal preferred-direction main phase.
Voltage-clamp recordings show that the centre is driven by preferred-direction-tuned
excitation while the surround is driven by null-direction-tuned excitation; inhibition becomes
essentially symmetric. The phenomenon generalises across all four cardinal On-Off DSGC
subtypes in the MEA data.

For this project the paper has two consequences. First, it confirms that the classical
inhibition-dominated DS substrate that t0091's compartmental model implements is the correct
target for a non-light-adapted photopic 16-direction protocol but is one regime among at least
two; the answer asset should explicitly scope its biological-plausibility ceiling claims to
photopic, non-light-adapted conditions and acknowledge that the surround-direction-flipping
excitation is a separate axis the v3 substrate does not score against. Second, the published
**DSI-on = 0.70 +/- 0.25** and **DSI-off = 0.65 +/- 0.30** baseline values serve as a hard
biological reference for evaluating whether any t0091 Pareto cell that achieves extremely high
DSI is super-biological rather than realistic.

Roy, Yao, Rathinavelu, and Field address the long-standing observation that
superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs (s-DSGCs) detect dim stimuli substantially more reliably than
the three other cardinal ooDSGC subtypes (anterior, inferior, posterior). The paper asks two
questions: how large is the s-DSGC sensitivity advantage at the absolute threshold of vision,
and which of three plausible mechanisms (RF size, Cx36 gap-junction coupling, GABAergic
inhibition asymmetry) account for it? The motivation comes from prior work (Yao et al. 2018)
suggesting s-DSGCs sacrifice direction-tuning precision for stimulus detection at scotopic
levels.

The authors record dark-adapted mouse retina ex vivo on a 519-electrode MEA, using brief
full-field LED flashes (2-8 ms) and spatially mapped square flashes (60-160 um, 900% contrast)
across backgrounds spanning six log units of light intensity. They quantify absolute
thresholds with a 2AFC ideal-observer analysis (84% correct = SNR = 1, Naka-Rushton fit) and
RF area by 2D-Gaussian fits to ON / OFF subfield maps. A calibrated rod-pooling model with
mouse-specific noise parameters and 0.005 R*/rod/s thermal isomerization rate is used to
translate RF area into predicted 2AFC performance. The mechanistic dissection uses FACx
conditional Cx36-knockout mice to ablate s-DSGC homotypic coupling, and 15 uM gabazine to
block GABA-A inhibition.

The headline result is a **10-fold lower s-DSGC absolute threshold** that approaches within
0.5 log unit of the most sensitive RGCs (presumed ON sustained alpha cells). RF size
differences (~8x larger ON subfields at scotopic 0.2 R*/rod/s) explain only **~50%** of the
gap, even under optimal nonlinear rod pooling. Cx36 ablation has **no significant effect** on
threshold and only a modest RF reduction in s-DSGCs. GABA-A blockade compresses the s-DSGC vs
other-ooDSGC threshold ratio from **9.4x to 3.2x**, expands all ooDSGC RFs (especially OFF
subfields by 10-30x), and unmasks a full-amplitude scotopic OFF response. The authors conclude
that two unidentified GABAergic amacrine cells differentially shape ooDSGC sensitivity, RF
size, and contrast polarity at low light, and explicitly exclude starburst amacrine cells as
the source.

For this project (t0091 morphology / NSGA-II Pareto-front sweep under photopic stimulation),
the paper supplies critical context but no parameter changes. Under photopic conditions the
s-DSGC RF-size advantage collapses to 1.5-3x with similar coverage factors across types,
supporting the project existing single-cell, single-operating-point Pareto framing using
Trenholm 2013-style photopic peak rates. The GABA spatial-gradient prior on the t0086 / t0088
scorecard is about classical-RF SAC-mediated inhibition; Roy 2024 two hypothesised
non-starburst GABAergic amacrine cells operate at scotopic levels and are out of scope. Cx36
gap-junction coupling can safely be excluded from the photopic single-cell model. The paper is
therefore most useful as an interpretive boundary - it confirms that t0091 photopic-only
NSGA-II results should not be overgeneralised to scotopic firing-rate predictions, where
additional GABAergic and OFF-masking mechanisms would dominate.

Tworig and colleagues address one specific developmental question: which molecules instruct
the asymmetric inhibitory wiring between starburst amacrine cell processes and the four ON-OFF
DSGC subtypes during the brief P9-P10 critical period? Prior work had shown that the
asymmetric inhibitory pattern emerges within roughly two postnatal days and persists in the
absence of visual input, suggesting an instructive molecular code, but the responsible
molecules were unknown. The authors target the postsynaptic side of this wiring problem in
mouse retina with a transcriptomic screen and a single conditional knockout follow-up.

The methodology combines paired patch-clamp (to time-stamp the wiring-onset day at P10), bulk
RNA-seq on FACS-isolated GFP-labelled nasal- vs ventral-preferring DSGCs from three transgenic
lines, and a Cbln4 conditional RGC knockout (Cbln4^fl/fl x VGlut2-Cre). Functional readouts
use two-photon population calcium imaging and whole-cell voltage-clamp during 8-direction
drifting-bar stimuli at 250 and 1,000 um/s, plus 3D dye-fill morphology reconstruction with
Sholl analysis. Statistical testing uses Wald tests with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR for
differential expression and permutation tests for direction-selective cell classification.

The screen yields **2,270 differentially expressed transcripts** including strong candidates
from the C1q/cerebellin family, protein tyrosine phosphatases, clustered protocadherins, and
Tenm3 splice isoforms. Cbln4 is **~100-fold enriched** in ventral-preferring (Hb9-GFP) DSGCs,
but the RGC-targeted KO produces only a **small DSI reduction** in the broader
ventral-preferring DSGC population and **no detectable difference** in IPSC amplitude,
asymmetry, or timing, EPSC properties, or dendritic morphology in voltage-clamp recordings.
The authors conclude that Cbln4 does not function cell-autonomously in DSGCs to instruct
asymmetric SAC->DSGC wiring, while still validating the differential-expression screen as a
discovery tool for other candidate molecules.

For this project, the paper is tangential to t0080 optimisation aims because t0080 operates on
a fixed deposited E/I substrate rather than reshaping it. The relevance is contextual: it
documents the developmental origin of the asymmetric inhibitory wiring that t0080 takes as a
fixed biological prior, validates that ventral-preferring DSGCs receive stronger inhibition
for dorsal motion (a hallmark feature already encoded in our target tuning curve), and reports
that excitation onto these cells is weakly direction-tuned with a ventral preference --
supporting the project continued treatment of the AMPA input distribution as approximately
symmetric. The ~100-fold Cbln4 enrichment hit with a small DSI phenotype is also a useful
negative-result anchor: it shows that single-gene perturbations of synaptic organisers do not
substantially redistribute the inhibitory tuning curve, so future tasks should keep the
project E/I substrate fixed at the canonical t0078/t0080 levels rather than attempting
biologically motivated perturbations of single synaptogenic molecules.

Werginz, Kiraly, and Zeck (2024) ask whether the spike generator of mouse alpha-RGCs is itself
tuned to each cell type downstream computational role, or whether sustained-vs-transient
firing phenotypes arise purely from upstream synaptic circuitry. They isolate the spike
generator pharmacologically, record from 73 wild-type and 48 rd10-degenerate alpha-RGCs across
three subtypes (alpha-ON sustained, alpha-OFF sustained, alpha-OFF transient), and quantify
nine spike-shape and firing-pattern features per cell.

The methodology combines whole-cell current-clamp recordings (with all major synaptic
transmission blocked) and a five-tier compartmental NEURON model. The model partitions an
alpha-RGC into dendrites, soma, soma-AIS, AIS, and axon, each with its own densities of Nav,
Kv, Cav, K(Ca), Ih, and leak - all calibrated to mouse rather than the historical rat/cat
parameter sets. AIS densities are particularly high (1300 mS/cm^2 Nav, 800 mS/cm^2 Kv),
establishing the AIS as the dominant spike-generation locus. UMAP + GMM clustering of the
spike-feature vectors achieves an adjusted Rand index of 0.8 against the morphological
cell-type labels.

The paper finds that the three alpha-RGC types differ substantially in intrinsic spike output:
alpha-OFF transient cells have the shortest spikes (**0.21 ms** vs **0.31 ms** for alpha-ON
sustained), the lowest sustained-to-peak ratio (**0.32** vs **0.57**), and the highest peak
firing rates (**346 Hz** vs **278 Hz**). The compartmental model reproduces these differences
via small modulations of AIS Nav density and somatic leak conductance. Crucially, the same
firing-type distinctions persist in rd10 photoreceptor-degenerated retina up to p227,
demonstrating that alpha-RGC intrinsic properties are circuit-independent once established.

For the t0078 multi-tier MOBO project, this paper is the most directly load-bearing source we
have seen for the 49-dimensional parameter-space tier bounds. The Werginz Table 1 densities
provide mouse-specific central tendencies for all six channels across all five compartments;
the soma-vs-AIS ratios (17.3x Nav, 16.7x Kv) and the dendritic Ih (1.30x somatic) define the
tier stratification structure that t0078 was designed around. The within-cell-type variance
also provides empirical sigma values for the prior, replacing the previously assumed values
lifted from Fohlmeister 2010. The model demonstration that +/- 20% modulation of AIS Nav and
somatic leak suffices to reproduce sustained-vs-transient differences provides a tight prior
for the most important search dimensions and justifies narrower bounds on K(Ca) and Cav,
freeing search budget for the high-leverage parameters.

Wu et al. (2023) build a compartmental macaque ON starburst amacrine cell (SAC) model in
NeuronC based on a connectomic reconstruction (Kim et al. 2022) and use it to resolve a
two-decade debate about the origin of direction selectivity (DS) in SAC dendrites. They
compare two mechanisms: the "morphological" mechanism (electrotonic delay along thin medial
dendrites plus a sealed-cable effect at thick distal tips), and the "space-time" mechanism
(spatially segregated sustained midget and transient DB4/5 bipolar inputs). By constructing
matched sustained-only and sustained+transient models they cleanly partition the two
contributions.

Methodologically, the model is dense enough to be realistic but simple enough to be
interpretable: 400-700 compartments, biophysically parameterised bipolar cells, a 2D stimulus
grid of bar widths (50-500 um) x velocities (100-10,000 um/s), and 30 random replicates per
cell. Voltage-gated Na and Ca channels are deliberately omitted from the SAC in the main
analysis to isolate the subthreshold origin of DS. A separate morphology sweep varies distal
(0.2-1.2 um) and medial (0.1-0.35 um) dendritic diameters, and a mouse SAC model (Ding et al.
2016 morphology) is run alongside as a cross-species morphology manipulation.

The headline result is a clean phase diagram: the morphological mechanism dominates for small,
fast objects (peak DSI ~0.32 at bar width 50 um, velocity 2000 um/s) while the space-time
mechanism dominates for large, slow objects (DSI goes from ~0.16 sustained-only to ~0.22
sustained+transient at 500 um bars, 200 um/s). DSI is maximised when medial diameter sits at
0.2-0.25 um (matching the EM anatomy) and distal diameter >=0.8 um. Dendritic N/P/Q Ca
channels regeneratively amplify the subthreshold DS signal (voltage DSI 0.28 -> 0.46, [Ca] DSI
0.78 in a single run). The mouse model reproduces the same phase structure despite different
bipolar input densities and spatial distribution.

For our t0027 literature survey on computational models linking neuronal morphology to DS,
this paper is a strong positive example of the sweep-morphology-measure-DS paradigm we are
documenting. The morphology variable is SAC dendritic geometry (not DSGC), and the outcome is
DSI at the distal varicosity. It provides a concrete anchor for (a) the expected DSI range in
SAC-only compartmental models (~0.1-0.4 in voltage, up to ~0.8 in dendritic Ca), (b) the
velocity-tuning curve of the morphological mechanism (peak near 2000 um/s in macaque), and (c)
the quantitative impact of medial vs distal diameter on DSI. Limitations to note for our
survey: the model omits GABAergic, glycinergic, and cholinergic network interactions; DSGC
morphology is absent; only one tree topology is used (diameters are swept but branching
pattern and total dendritic length are not). These gaps will need to be filled by other papers
in the survey that sweep DSGC morphology or vary branching asymmetry.

This paper addresses a longstanding open question in retinal direction selectivity: whether
the connectomically-inspired "space-time wiring" model — in which proximal starburst amacrine
cell (SAC) dendrites receive tonic/sustained glutamate release from BC7 bipolar cells and
distal dendrites receive transient release from BC5 subtypes — is experimentally verifiable
and computationally sufficient to shape SAC dendritic direction selectivity. Prior imaging
surveys had reported uniform BC kinetics, casting doubt on the model, while prior connectomic
and voltage-clamp work had left the input-kinetic verification gap unclosed. Srivastava et al.
close this gap by combining SAC-targeted iGluSnFR imaging with compartmental modeling.

Methodologically, the authors injected Cre-dependent iGluSnFR into ChAT-Cre mouse retinas and
imaged glutamate signals at 5 µm ROI resolution along individual ON-SAC dendrites and across
population fields of view, varying stimulus spot size from 100 to 800 µm and applying a
GABA_A/GABA_C/AMPA blocker cocktail to isolate network contributions. They then deconvolved
the fluorescence with a fitted quantal iGluSnFR kernel to recover per-site vesicle release
rates, which they fed into a ball-and-stick NEURON SAC model whose synapse positions were
sampled from Ding et al. 2016 connectomic BC7/BC5 probability density functions (6 proximal +
12 distal per trial).

Empirically, they find a robust proximal-to-distal gradient in sustained/transient index (STi
≈ 0.33 proximal vs 0.16 distal on single dendrites, 0.34 vs 0.21 at population level), a 3×
higher steady-state release rate proximally (~3 vs ~1 vesicles/s), persistence of this
gradient under full inhibitory blockade, and — critically — in silico demonstrations that
swapping the proximal/distal kinetic arrangement reverses the SAC's preferred direction, that
homogenizing kinetics abolishes DS, and that DSi grows linearly with proximal-distal BC
separation distance. The effect is statistically significant up to 1 mm/s stimulus velocity
and strongest below 0.5 mm/s.

For the present project's morphology-shapes-DS literature survey, this paper is important for
three reasons. First, it is a clean example of **input-on-dendrite morphology** shaping DS:
the spatial arrangement of kinetically distinct synaptic inputs *along* the SAC dendrite,
rather than the dendritic branching structure per se, produces the DS signal — a mechanism
readily generalizable to DSGC models constrained by connectomic priors. Second, it provides a
validated pipeline (iGluSnFR → temporal deconvolution → release-rate-driven NEURON model)
reusable for DSGC studies. Third, it delineates the **scope limitation** of the
space-time-wiring mechanism (slow stimuli only), which must be respected when extrapolating to
DSGC DS where high-velocity DS is known to be robust. The paper is tagged "SAC, not DSGC" in
our survey: it operates one layer upstream of the canonical DSGC but contributes a mechanism
that any end-to-end morphology-DS model of the DSGC-afferent circuit must incorporate.

Wienbar and Schwartz introduce the Bursty Suppressed-by-Contrast (bSbC) RGC of the mouse
retina and ask why it transmits a contrast-suppression signal while the OFF sustained Alpha
(OFFsA) RGC, which receives nearly identical synaptic input, transmits a high-rate
sustained-contrast signal. The paper's research question is therefore explicitly about the
contribution of cell-intrinsic spike generation machinery, rather than upstream circuitry, to
RGC feature selectivity.

The methodology combines voltage-clamp measurement of excitatory and inhibitory conductance
traces, current-clamp recordings of spike shape, confocal imaging of the AIS labelled with
ankyrin-G, sodium-channel pharmacology with the Nav1.6-selective blocker 49TTX, and a NEURON
7.7 compartmental model in which the AIS is split into a proximal Nav1.2 subsegment and a
distal Nav1.6 subsegment. The two cell types share the same dendritic and somatic architecture
in the model, and the only systematic differences are AIS length (22 +/- 1.7 um in OFFsA vs 16
+/- 1.5 um in bSbC) and Nav1.6 fraction (~40 percent in OFFsA vs ~0 percent in bSbC).

The headline finding is that the divergent contrast response functions of the two cells emerge
from the spike generator alone. The bSbC cell's short, Nav1.2-dominated AIS is driven into
depolarisation block by strong contrast inputs, silencing the cell, while OFFsA's longer
Nav1.6-rich AIS sustains high firing rates under the same drive. 49TTX selectively reduces
OFFsA spike amplitude with no effect on bSbC, confirming the Nav1.6 contribution. AIS length
differs significantly (p = 0.018) while diameter does not (p = 0.83), localising the
anatomical signature.

For task t0078 (and the broader project) the paper matters in three ways. First, it provides a
public, openly licensed NEURON model of a two-subsegment AIS with realistic Nav1.2/Nav1.6
parameterisation, length 16-22 um, and diameter ~1.3 um, archived at Zenodo DOI
10.5281/zenodo.6423531. This is the substrate that t0078 is going to port in place of the
paywalled Werginz 2020 model. Second, it establishes that AIS heterogeneity is an empirically
documented driver of RGC feature selectivity, not just a modelling convenience, which
strengthens the biological-plausibility case for tiered AHP plus tiered AIS in the DSGC v2
model. Third, it demonstrates depolarisation block as a meaningful coding mechanism, which
means t0078's firing-rate metrics need to remain well-defined when the AIS enters block under
strong drive.

El-Quessny and Feller test whether the global shape of a DSGC’s dendritic arbor determines how
its excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are spatially organized. They exploit a natural
biological contrast: Hb9::GFP vDSGCs have strongly asymmetric dendrites oriented toward the
preferred direction, while Trhr::GFP nDSGCs have symmetric dendrites but similar
direction-selective spike output. The motivation is to dissociate two classical mechanisms of
retinal direction selectivity, tuned inhibition and spatially offset inhibition, and to ask
which of them tracks dendritic morphology.

Methodologically, the authors combine two-photon targeted whole-cell voltage clamp of EPSCs
(V_hold = -70 mV) and IPSCs (V_hold = 0 mV) with per-cell morphological reconstruction in
flat-mount mouse retina. Cells are probed with both drifting bars (eight directions, 250 um/s)
and a 10 x 10 stationary flash grid over a 500 x 500 um soma-centered field (30 x 30 um
squares), which allows independent measurement of directional tuning and 2D receptive-field
geometry. Additional experiments block nAChRs with 100 uM hexamethonium to separate
cholinergic from glutamatergic excitation, and a set of vector-based COM analyses quantifies
dendritic asymmetry, E-to-I spatial offset, per-pixel E vs I correlation, and the ratio of
synaptic-field to dendritic-field area.

The headline findings are a clean dissociation. Asymmetric vDSGCs show significantly sharper
directional tuning of inhibition than symmetric nDSGCs (IPSC DSI **0.48** vs **0.34** ON;
**0.56** vs **0.31** OFF), driven by weaker preferred-side inhibition. However, E-to-I spatial
offsets are small (**<50 um**) and comparable between subtypes, E and I amplitudes are locally
correlated (R^2 ~ 0.51-0.65 per pixel), and both receptive fields exceed the dendritic field
by a factor of **~1.6-3.3** because of cholinergic (SAC) input. Pharmacological block of
nAChRs shrinks the excitatory receptive field toward the dendritic field and reveals that
nDSGC glutamatergic fields point toward the null direction, whereas vDSGC glutamatergic fields
remain biased toward the preferred direction.

For this project, which aims to match single-DSGC angle-to-AP-frequency curves in a
compartmental model, the paper is foundational. It tells us (i) dendritic asymmetry matters
for tuned inhibition but not for spatial E/I organization, so a compartmental model that
ignores global morphology can still reproduce E/I spatial structure if it gets SAC-mediated
wiring right; (ii) synapse distributions should cover **1.6-3.3x** the dendritic footprint
with a co-varying local E/I amplitude ratio; (iii) the E-to-I spatial offset along the
preferred axis is **<50 um** and inhibition is locally correlated with excitation in strength;
and (iv) reproducing the gap between stationary-map and drifting-bar offsets requires
stimulus-dependent recruitment of lateral inhibition. These quantitative constraints directly
feed into the AMPA/GABA placement, synaptic density maps, and stimulus protocols used to tune
the project’s DSGC compartmental model.

Ezra-Tsur and colleagues attack a long-standing problem in retinal computation: determining
which of several competing mechanisms (input layout, input kinetics, intrinsic ion channels,
reciprocal inhibition) produces the centrifugal preference of SAC dendrites that, in turn,
drives direction selectivity in DSGCs. Because these mechanisms are experimentally difficult
to isolate, the authors build RSME - a NEURON-encapsulating framework that ties together
detailed morphology, biophysics, retinal connectivity rules, and visual stimuli - and use it
as a counterfactual engine.

The methodological core is a genetic-algorithm sweep over an 8-dimensional parameter space
that controls the spatial density of bipolar-to-SAC synapses and the per-synapse release
kinetics, holding the passive SAC morphology (1013-compartment NeuroMorpho NMO_139062) fixed.
By varying only the input-on-dendrite layout the authors show that spatiotemporally diverse
excitation - sustained proximal, transient distal - is sufficient to reproduce experimentally
measured CSI (~0.18) and RTI (~0.33); reversing the arrangement eliminates CF preference (0/N
cells), and fixing it gives 4/2125 barely-CF cells. In a subsequent 13-SAC network, reciprocal
inhibition modulates but does not generate CF preference, peaking at ~0.1 nS.

The DSGC results are the most load-bearing for this project morphology-focused survey:
embedding a reconstructed DSGC (NMO_05318, 1013 compartments, passive, -49 mV threshold, -52
mV baseline) in the SAC network and flipping between random and asymmetric null-side
SAC-to-DSGC wiring shows that asymmetric wiring alone produces positive DSI and PD activation,
even when the SAC network has no CF preference. SAC-SAC inhibition improves DSI modestly under
noiseless stimuli and strongly under noisy stimuli - reproducing the Chen et al. short-term
depression mechanism - while asymmetric wiring remains necessary throughout. These are
specific, quantitative necessity/sufficiency claims.

For this project on computational models linking neuronal morphology to direction-selectivity,
the paper is a clear inclusion: it uses compartmental models with explicit reconstructed
morphology, it varies the input-on-dendrite layout (and separately the SAC-SAC inhibition
strength) as the causal variable, and it measures DSGC outcome via DSI and related indices. It
should be cited as the canonical RSME reference, and the specific numerical anchors
(compartment counts, conductances, Exp2Syn parameters, 0.1 nS SAC-SAC, 0.5 nS SAC-DSGC,
spiking threshold -49 mV) should be reused as starting points or baselines in any follow-up
morphology-sweep tasks that embed a DSGC in a SAC network. A limitation is that SACs are
passive-only (no ion channels), so claims about the role of SAC intrinsic properties versus
input layout are by construction bounded - this is explicitly acknowledged in the Discussion,
and the authors note RSME can implement active channels in future studies.

Goethals et al. study the biophysical organization of the axon initial segment in mouse
retinal ganglion cells, addressing how a narrow (~1 um diameter) structure reliably transmits
the action potential to the much larger soma. The AIS must produce an axial current strong
enough to depolarize the soma by ~30 mV to reach somatic spike regeneration threshold, a
demanding requirement given the geometric impedance mismatch at the axosomatic junction. Prior
estimates of AIS Nav conductance density in RGCs came only from computational model fitting to
AP shape; this paper provides the first direct functional measurement via the axial current
itself.

The approach combines whole-cell voltage-clamp measurement of the axial current with post-hoc
ankyrin-G immunolabeling to measure AIS geometry in each recorded cell (P10-12 mouse retina, n
= 14-17 cells). Resistive coupling theory is applied to these paired measurements to estimate
AIS Nav conductance density. Additionally, the adaptation of the axial current with membrane
potential is characterized, revealing that temporal broadening by Kv1 channel inactivation
reduces effective charge attenuation from 12-fold (peak current) to only 3-fold (total charge)
over a 20 mV depolarization.

Key quantitative results: mean axial current **-6.7 +/- 1.8 nA**; minimum Nav conductance
density from cable theory **~1200 S/m2 (d = 1 um)** or **~2467 S/m2 (d = 0.8 um)**; best-fit
from resistive coupling theory **~5000-5500 S/m2 (50-55 mS/cm2)**; charge-capacitance slope
**31 mV** matching the spike-to-regeneration gap; **12-fold peak current** versus **3-fold
charge attenuation** over 20 mV depolarization. These converge with Guo et al. 2013 model
estimates (5000 S/m2) and Werginz 2020 Sci. Adv. values (~1300 mS/cm2).

For t0080, this paper provides an independent empirical lower bound on AIS Nav density in
mouse RGCs supporting the hard biological floor nav16_ais >= 0.25 S/cm2. The conservative
minimum (~10-12.6 mS/cm2) exceeds this floor by ~40-50x; the best-fit (~50-55 mS/cm2) by
~200x, confirming the floor is conservative. The paper establishes that AIS diameter is a
critical free parameter (0.7-1.2 um proximal range from measurements) and that the charge-
capacitance coupling principle should inform how AIS geometry bounds are set relative to soma
size in t0080 MOBO optimization.

This eLife paper asks a specific question about retinal direction selectivity: at what spatial
scale is the direction-selective computation actually performed inside the dendrites of an
ON-OFF DSGC? The question is motivated by decades of theoretical work (Koch, Poggio & Torre
1982; Schachter et al. 2010) proposing dendritic subunits on a 50–100 µm scale, by anatomical
evidence that starburst amacrine cells wrap varicosities around DSGC dendrites with
direction-dependent orientation (Briggman et al. 2011), and by earlier patch-clamp results
(Sivyer & Williams 2013) suggesting subthreshold local tuning. The authors set out to measure
that spatial scale directly in an intact mouse retina.

Their methodology combines two-photon Ca²⁺ imaging of small (3–4 µm) dendritic ROIs in
OGB-1-loaded DSGCs with voltage-gated Na⁺ channel blockade (intracellular QX-314 or bath TTX),
pharmacological dissection of NMDA receptors (D-AP5), genetic disruption of GABA release from
starburst amacrine cells (vGAT-KO), mechanical ablation of individual SACs via sharp-electrode
lesions, and a multi-compartmental NEURON model of a reconstructed DSGC with 177 E/I synaptic
pairs and stochastic release. The combination of imaging, targeted circuit perturbation, and
biophysical simulation is the paper's methodological core.

The headline findings are that DS information exists and is independently generated inside
5–10 µm dendritic segments — an order of magnitude smaller than classic cable-theory
estimates; that noise correlations between dendritic ROIs fall off with a 5.3 µm space
constant; that dendritic Ca²⁺ tuning matches somatic spiking tuning and is sharper than
subthreshold somatic voltage; that NMDA receptors scale responses multiplicatively without
altering PD or DSI; that ablating just 3–7 null-side SACs selectively disrupts DS at
interspersed dendritic hot spots leaving other segments intact; and that a soft dendritic
voltage threshold in the CaV activation range (−55 to −48 mV) is sufficient in the model to
convert homogeneously-tuned inputs into strongly-tuned, locally-independent compartments.

For this project the paper is central. It pins down the empirical target that an ON-OFF DSGC
compartmental model must reproduce: sharp somatic directional tuning that emerges from many
small, locally-tuned dendritic segments whose independence is enforced by dendritic threshold
nonlinearities and by spatially-precise GABAergic inhibition. It also supplies an explicit set
of channel conductances, a morphology reference (Poleg-Polsky & Diamond 2016), a ratio of 1:1
excitatory-to-inhibitory synapse count (177 each), and a concrete prediction — active
dendritic Na⁺/K⁺ channels are expected to sharpen tuning — that we will test directly as part
of our active-vs-passive dendrite experiment. The measured DSI distribution, angular SD of
~32°, and 5–10 µm compartment scale give us quantitative benchmarks to score candidate model
configurations against.

Werginz, Raghuram, and Fried investigate how intrinsic biophysics downstream of the dendrites
shapes the spike output of OFF-alpha transient retinal ganglion cells. Their hypothesis is
that the AIS is specialised to match the synaptic input that each cell type receives. Using a
combined experimental and computational approach (patch-clamp current-clamp recordings, Nav1.6
and ankyrin-G immunohistochemistry, and NEURON compartmental modelling) they show that AIS
morphology and sodium channel density are the primary determinants of maximum firing rate and
depolarisation-block threshold.

The methodology is carefully matched: the same OFF-alphaT cell population is characterised
electrophysiologically, anatomically, and computationally. Dorsal and ventral retinal
locations are compared because prior work showed that OFF-alphaT cells receive different
synaptic drive in these regions; the intrinsic-biophysics question is whether the output side
is also tuned. The compartmental model serves as a mechanistic bridge, varying only AIS
parameters while holding dendritic and somatic properties constant, to test whether AIS alone
can explain the observed firing-rate differences.

The headline quantitative results are a 7x AIS-to-soma Na+ density ratio, a systematic
AIS-length difference between dorsal and ventral OFF-alphaT cells, and the demonstration that
AIS length alone is sufficient to reproduce the firing-rate and depolarisation-block
differences in the compartmental model. Dorsal cells have longer AISs and sustain higher
firing rates; ventral cells have shorter AISs and enter depolarisation block at lower input
currents.

For this project, the implications are direct. DSGC compartmental models must include an
explicit AIS compartment with Nav1.6 enrichment at the reported density ratio, AIS length
should be a named tunable parameter constrained by immunohistochemistry rather than a fixed
value, and depolarisation-block behaviour must be used as a fitting constraint. Ignoring the
AIS will produce a DSGC model that cannot correctly reproduce high-firing-rate and
strong-contrast responses.

Hanson et al. revisit one of the most entrenched assumptions in retinal neuroscience: that
direction selectivity in direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) is inherited from
the directionally tuned GABA release of starburst amacrine cells. They ask whether DSGCs can
still compute direction when starburst output itself is no longer directional, a question made
answerable for the first time by combining the Gabra2 conditional KO (which removes mutual SAC
inhibition) with optogenetic stimulation of SACs while bipolar-cell drive is pharmacologically
silenced.

Methodologically, the study integrates four approaches: cell-specific genetics to control SAC
inhibition, ChR2 optogenetics to control excitation of SACs in isolation, whole-cell and loose
cell-attached patch-clamp recordings to read out EPSCs, IPSCs, and spiking in the same DSGCs,
and a multicompartmental NEURON model (built on the Poleg-Polsky and Diamond 2016 DSGC
morphology) to test the computational sufficiency of the proposed mechanisms. Pharmacology
(hexamethonium, SR-95531, DL-AP4, UBP310, CNQX, D-AP5) isolates cholinergic, GABAergic, and
glutamatergic components. Modelling synapses and somatic Na/K/delayed-rectifier conductances
are set to densities matched to prior literature, and release probabilities are parameterised
sigmoidally with direction.

The central findings are that (i) starburst IPSC direction selectivity can be essentially
abolished (DSI about 0.07) while DSGC spiking remains robustly directional; (ii) the residual
DS is explained by a directionally tuned excitation-inhibition temporal offset of up to 50 ms
in the preferred direction, which corresponds to a relatively fixed 25-30 microm spatial
offset across velocities; (iii) this offset is cholinergic in origin, since hexamethonium
delays preferred-direction EPSCs by about 25 ms and collapses the offset; and (iv) the two DS
mechanisms (amplitude and timing) dominate different phases of the response: offsets sharpen
the early phase, amplitude differences broaden and stabilise the peak phase. The NEURON model
reproduces all of these features under both full and reduced wiring.

For this project, Hanson et al. 2019 is directly relevant on three fronts. First, it
constrains the target tuning curve: a single trial-averaged angle-to-AP-frequency curve is
unlikely to capture the dual-mechanism structure, so the target should ideally include
early-versus-peak temporal structure. Second, it provides a specific, reconstructed, publicly
available NEURON model (`geoffder/Spatial-Offset-DSGC-NEURON-Model`) with the exact
conductance recipe, passive properties, and distributed AMPA/ACh/GABA synapses needed as a
baseline for the morphology/conductance/input parametric variation planned here. Third, it
establishes that any realistic DSGC model in this project must treat excitation as two
distinct populations (bipolar AMPA and starburst ACh) with different spatial offsets, because
their differential timing is itself a DS mechanism that must be represented if the optimiser
is to fit mouse DSGC behaviour rather than a generic ON-OFF ganglion cell.

Morrie and Feller ask which morphological feature of the starburst amacrine cell plexus is
necessary for direction-selective tuning in retinal ganglion cells. Prior work established
that asymmetric SAC-to-DSGC inhibition is central to DS, and that SAC dendrites themselves are
tuned to centrifugal motion, but it was unknown whether loss of DS in morphology-mutant mice
reflected broken wiring, broken subcellular computation, or a broken circuit geometry. The
Sema6A-/- mouse offers a clean dissection because it preserves SAC cell number and GABAergic
identity but reduces arbor size and plexus overlap.

The authors combine cell-attached DSGC spike recordings, whole-cell voltage-clamp IPSC
measurements, paired SAC-DSGC patch recordings with dye fills (AlexaFluor488 for DSGCs,
AlexaFluor594 for SACs), 2-photon OGB1 Ca2+ imaging of SAC varicosities, manual morphology
tracing in FIJI Simple Neurite Tracer exported as SWC files to the TREES toolbox, and a custom
IPSC simulation in MATLAB. Mice were p25-120 CNT (ChAT-Cre/nGFP/TrHr) reporter crosses. The
experimental design cleanly separates wiring (paired recordings), subcellular computation
(Ca2+ imaging), and geometric arrangement (reconstructed SAC arbors with varicosity positions
and distal-segment orientations).

Three findings carry the paper. First, DSGC directional tuning collapses in Sema6A-/- because
null-direction inhibition is halved (~4 nS to ~1.5 nS) while preferred-direction inhibition is
unchanged. Second, paired SAC-DSGC recordings show that asymmetric wiring and per-synapse
conductance are preserved. Third, Ca2+ imaging shows that SAC varicosity-level DS is preserved
but that ~30-40% of Sema6A-/- varicosities are not tuned to centrifugal motion; instead their
preferred direction follows the orientation of a short distal (10-40 micrometre) neurite
segment, and a TREES-toolbox-based IPSC simulation with each SAC's measured varicosity
geometry reproduces the observed DSGC IPSC tuning loss.

For this project the paper's relevance is both scientific and operational. Scientifically, it
establishes that our compartmental DSGC model must couple SAC plexus coverage and local
distal-segment orientation to the amplitude and preferred direction of each GABAergic input; a
model that only varies per-synapse weight will miss the dominant mechanism of null-direction
inhibition. Operationally, for task t0013 the paper provides decisive negative evidence: its
Methods describe only SAC reconstructions (FIJI to SWC to TREES), never DSGC reconstructions,
biocytin fills, Neurolucida tracings, a `141009` or `Pair1DSGC` identifier, or a NeuroMorpho
deposition statement. The NeuroMorpho.org linkage of neuron 102976 to this DOI is therefore
not supported by the paper itself and must be resolved by inspecting a different Feller-lab
source (lab repository, earlier paired-recording paper, or unpublished deposition metadata).

Koren, Grove, and Wei address a gap in the mechanistic understanding of retinal direction
selectivity: how the starburst amacrine cell (SAC) maintains the required balance between
electrotonic isolation and cross-compartmental signal integration in its dendrites, and how
that balance is regulated and coupled to direction-selective ganglion cell (DSGC) output.
Earlier work established that SAC dendritic sectors are semi-independent computational units
with centrifugal preference, but the mechanisms controlling the "semi" part of that isolation
were unknown.

Methodologically the paper combines two-photon GCaMP6 imaging of distal SAC varicosities,
whole-cell patch-clamp of SACs and DSGCs, subregion visual stimulation to dissociate local
from global dendritic activation, a selective pharmacology (LY341495 antagonist and LY354740
agonist) for mGluR2, and mGluR2 knockout mice as an off-target control. Voltage-gated calcium
channel subtypes are identified with omega-conotoxin GVIA (N-type) and omega-agatoxin IVA
(P/Q-type).

The central findings are that (i) the strong centrifugal response of distal SAC varicosities
during full-field motion is partly produced by trans-somatic signal integration from the
opposite side of the dendritic tree; (ii) mGluR2 signaling inhibits N- and P/Q-type VGCCs on
SACs to enforce sufficient electrotonic isolation during centripetal motion; (iii) blocking
mGluR2 selectively enhances preferred-direction IPSCs onto DSGCs (delay **289 ms at 440
um/s**, **147 ms at 1100 um/s**); and (iv) this aberrant inhibition reduces DSGC spiking
specifically at high motion speeds, contributing to the broad speed tuning of the
direction-selective circuit.

For this project's goal of a compartmental DSGC model that matches a target
angle-to-AP-frequency curve, the paper has two concrete implications. First, the IPSC input
model on the DSGC must reflect speed-dependent latency and amplitude arising from SAC
trans-somatic propagation rather than a speed-invariant null-direction inhibition. Second, the
saturation of centrifugal SAC calcium signals and null-direction DSGC IPSCs, even under strong
pharmacological perturbation, suggests that the target tuning curve can be reproduced with a
degenerate set of Na/K conductance combinations (RQ1 "ridge" hypothesis), because upstream
inhibition is the first-order constraint on firing at preferred direction and any well-chosen
conductance combination that preserves somatic excitability will suffice. Active dendritic
conductances in the DSGC (RQ4) can be evaluated against this framework, but the primary
directional signal arrives pre-shaped by SAC compartmental computation, not generated locally
in the DSGC dendrites.

Sethuramanujam and colleagues address a gap in the DSGC direction-selectivity literature: is
the AMPAR-and-inhibition picture of DS generation complete, or do NMDARs also play a
functional role in the adult circuit? Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from ON-OFF
DSGCs in mouse retinal wholemount, combined with drifting-grating and moving-bar motion
stimuli and pharmacological block of AMPARs and NMDARs, they answer the question by directly
measuring each receptor component during preferred and null motion.

The methodology combines voltage-clamp at multiple holding potentials to isolate excitatory
and inhibitory components, pharmacological dissection to isolate AMPA and NMDA contributions
within the excitatory component, and matched current-clamp recordings to confirm the
spike-output consequences. The design lets the authors quantify the AMPA/NMDA ratio, its
direction dependence, and the effect of NMDAR block on direction selectivity index separately
at the synaptic-current and spike levels.

The headline result is that DSGCs contain a substantial but functionally silent NMDAR
population that is recruited preferentially during preferred-direction motion and
multiplicatively enhances DS. NMDAR block reduces DSI significantly at both the current and
spike level. The paper also provides quantitative AMPA/NMDA charge ratios that can be used
directly as model-fitting targets.

For this project, the implications are central. DSGC compartmental models in NEURON must
include NMDARs with proper Mg2+ block kinetics on DSGC dendrites; the AMPA-only baseline is
inadequate. NMDAR recruitment depends on dendritic depolarisation, so space-clamp corrections
from Poleg-Polsky and To-Honnuraiah-Stuart apply. Fitting objectives should include the
AMPA/NMDA charge ratio during preferred and null motion, not just peak AMPA current. The
Sethuramanujam measurements provide the quantitative targets our model must hit.

Baden, Berens, Franke, Roman Roson, Bethge, and Euler used dense two-photon calcium imaging of
RGC somata in whole-mount mouse retina, combined with a standardised stimulus battery (chirp,
moving bar, full-field, coloured, checkerboard) and unsupervised probabilistic clustering, to
produce a near-saturating taxonomy of mouse RGC functional types. Across 11,210 cell
recordings from 15 retinas, they identify a minimum of 32 RGC functional groups — nearly
double the prior anatomical estimate of 15-20 — plus an additional ~17 displaced amacrine cell
groups.

The clustering strategy is methodologically important: rather than mixing direction-selective
and non-DS cells in a single clustering pass, the authors first apply a permutation-based DS
significance test (cell_dp < 0.05) and cluster the two subsets independently, then merge
similar clusters back together with explicit evidence. This yields 24 DS clusters merged into
8 DS- dominated groups (G2, G6, G12, G13, G16, G25, G26, G29) that account for 70% of all
1,757 DS cells. They confirm cluster identities via independent juxtacellular
electrophysiology with biocytin fills, immunohistochemistry for known markers (GAD67, SMI-32,
melanopsin), and genetic labels in PV-Cre and Pcp2 transgenic lines. Cluster quality is high
for major groups (median posterior > 0.9) and coverage factors typically cluster around 1,
supporting interpretation as single types.

The paper's primary results are quantitatively striking. Of 11,210 imaged GCL somata, 7,982
were RGCs; the remaining cells were displaced amacrines or unclassifiable. Of the RGCs, 1,757
(35%) were direction-selective at the cell_dp < 0.05 significance threshold. The 32 RGC groups
break down into 9 OFF + 12 ON + 3 ON-OFF non-DS groups and 2 OFF + 4 ON + 2 ON-OFF DS groups.
Cluster posterior quality exceeds 0.9 for the major groups, coverage factors cluster around 1
for most groups, and biocytin morphologies in a 245-cell validation subset confirm
cluster-to-morphology correspondence for the classical alpha, JAM-B, and ON-OFF DS types.

For this project, the Baden 2016 paper and the accompanying Dryad release define the canonical
reference dataset for direction-selective RGC properties in the mouse retina. The 8
DS-containing groups, their cluster-mean moving-bar responses, IPL stratification depths, and
scalar indices (DSi, OSi, response quality) are the targets that any DSGC compartmental
simulation in this project must match. The per-cell traces enable construction of
biologically-grounded parameter envelopes for the t0090 morphology generator and validation
distributions for the t0102 joint-pass corner. The principal limitation is that morphological
reconstructions are not provided for the bulk of recorded cells — DS-cell morphologies for
downstream modelling must be sourced from a complementary paper such as Bae et al. 2018 or Ran
et al. 2020. The cell-level reconciliation of the user- supplied cluster IDs `[2, 17, 18, 19,
22, 35, 36, 40]` against the authoritative paper taxonomy is recorded in
`code/visualization_code_notes.md`; only G2 from the user list is in the paper's DS-group set,
which is documented as a blocking intervention in `intervention/cluster_id_mismatch.json`.

Ding et al. use serial block-face EM to reconstruct the complete synaptic wiring of four
starburst amacrine cells in mouse retina and compare it with the previously characterised
rabbit circuit. The central finding is that mouse SACs receive inhibitory SAC-SAC inputs
exclusively on their proximal dendrites, whereas rabbit SACs receive them distally. The study
is motivated by the need to understand which circuit features -- intrinsic or network-based --
account for direction selectivity of SAC dendrites, and whether that organisation varies
across species.

To interpret the anatomy, the authors construct a 7-SAC network model in Neuron-C with
anatomically measured dendritic diameters, biophysically grounded active conductances (NaV1.8,
Kdr, L-type Ca^2+), and synapse placements derived from the EM data. Mouse-like (proximal
inhibition, 145 um inter-soma spacing) and rabbit-like (distal inhibition, 200 um spacing)
configurations are compared over stimulus velocities 30-2000 um/s. Two-photon calcium imaging
and SR95531 pharmacology confirm the model predictions in vitro.

Key quantitative results: the mouse model remains DS down to ~100 um/s linear velocity,
matching the smaller mouse eye (3 mm axial diameter, ~30 um/deg) to conserve angular velocity
tuning. Distributing BC inputs uniformly reverses direction preference in the model. SAC-SAC
inhibition is necessary for DS at high contrast (300%) and for DS to centrally restricted
stimuli in mouse. Full biophysical parameters (Rm = 10,000 Ohm-cm^2, Ri = 75 Ohm-cm,
NaV1.8/Kdr/Ca^2+ densities per dendritic zone) are tabulated and distributed with the model
code.

For this project, Ding et al. (2016) provides three concrete resources: (1) a fully described
multi-compartmental DS circuit model with biophysical parameters and DSI protocol that can
directly inform DSGC model parameterisation; (2) a design principle -- restrict excitatory
inputs to proximal zones away from the output zone -- guiding AMPA vs. GABA placement in the
DSGC dendritic model; and (3) mouse-specific synaptic geometry (inhibitory inputs at proximal
third, excitatory at proximal two-thirds) to validate against when choosing GABA input
distributions in the project compartmental DSGC model.

Poleg-Polsky and Diamond investigate how direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) in the
mouse retina amplify visual signals while preserving reliable directional tuning. The central
question is why NMDA receptors are present on DSGC dendrites when direction selectivity can be
computed without them. The answer proposed is that NMDARs provide multiplicative gain --
scaling responses in both the preferred and null directions by the same factor -- which
maintains the direction-selectivity index, increases absolute signal amplitude, and improves
resistance to visual noise.

The experiments combine whole-cell patch-clamp from GFP-labeled DRD4 mouse DSGCs with a
morphologically realistic multicompartmental NEURON model containing 177 AMPAR + 177 NMDAR +
177 GABA_A synapses on reconstructed ON dendrites. Slope-angle analysis distinguishes
multiplicative from additive NMDAR scaling. Two pharmacological manipulations convert
multiplication to addition: removing voltage-dependent Mg2+ block and reversing GABAergic
inhibition to excitation with high-Cl- internal solution. The NEURON model replicates all
experimental PSP and AP responses and predicts additive NMDAR scaling under both
pharmacological conditions.

The key finding is that NMDAR multiplication requires the conjunction of voltage-dependent
NMDAR conductance and directionally tuned GABAergic inhibition. Under noiseless conditions,
NMDAR blockade preserves DSI but reduces AP firing amplitude. Under noisy conditions, ROC
analysis demonstrates significantly better signal discrimination with intact NMDARs than with
AP5 or 0 Mg2+. Dendritic spikes were absent in DRD4 DSGCs; passive propagation proved
sufficient for DS computation.

For this project, the Poleg-Polsky & Diamond NEURON model is the essential template. Its
geometry (single reconstructed DRD4 DSGC), synaptic counts (177 AMPA + 177 GABA on ON
dendrites), and circuit architecture (tuned GABAergic inhibition as stronger ND conductance)
directly match the planned implementation. Available on ModelDB (accession 189347). The paper
validates passive- dendrite sufficiency for project RQ4, constrains NMDAR conductance
Mg2+-block parameters, and establishes ROC accuracy-curve area as the appropriate metric for
comparing DS tuning fidelity across model variants.

Poleg-Polsky and Diamond ask how the retinal direction-selective circuit, which is organized
as a feedforward inhibitory microcircuit (bipolar cell → starburst amacrine cell →
direction-selective ganglion cell), keeps its excitation / inhibition ratio stable across a
wide contrast range even though the SAC interposes a highly nonlinear dendritic release step.
Using whole-cell recordings, pharmacology, two-photon Ca2+ imaging, and iGluSnFR in mouse
retina, they show that the DSGC E/I ratio is indeed contrast-independent (r = 0.94) and that
this is not because of postsynaptic receptor differences between cholinergic, NMDAR and AMPAR
components, which all share the same contrast sensitivity.

The compensating mechanism lives in the bipolar-cell layer: BCs that drive SACs are far more
contrast-sensitive (detection threshold ~16 % contrast, half-activation ~32 %) than BCs that
drive DSGCs (threshold ~65 %). Direct imaging of SAC dendritic Ca2+ shows that the SAC I/O
transform is steeply sigmoidal (threshold ~38 %, half-activation ~66 %), so the elevated
presynaptic sensitivity of SAC-targeting BCs exactly offsets the SAC nonlinearity, leaving the
feedforward GABAergic output at the DSGC contrast-matched to the direct BC → DSGC excitation.
Single-bouton recordings show this sensitivity difference is between BC subtypes, not within
them, and correlates with distinct IPL stratification.

A stochastic compartmental DSGC model (121 ON-layer compartments; AMPA, NMDA and GABA
conductances with realistic kinetics and Jahr-Stevens NMDA voltage dependence; Hodgkin-Huxley
spike generator) is used to show that matched E/I contrast tuning maximizes suprathreshold
DSI. Shifting E or I along the contrast axis either leaks non-directional null responses
through the circuit or quenches spikes altogether, confirming that the presynaptic
BC-heterogeneity mechanism is functionally necessary, not merely present.

For this project the paper is a **borderline** but important inclusion. The morphology of the
DSGC is held fixed and the primary contribution is circuit-level, so it is not a
morphology-on-DS modeling paper in the strict sense. However, the compartmental DSGC model
with spatially distributed E and I inputs, and the explicit demonstration that the
*distribution* of E/I contrast tuning across dendritic compartments gates reliable DS
computation, make this a key reference for how E/I-on-morphology shapes DS. It should be cited
alongside PolegPolsky2026 when arguing that DSGC dendritic biophysics and synaptic spatial
statistics — not just SAC wiring — determine direction-selective reliability, and its synapse
parameterization can be reused as a validated starting point for our own DSGC simulations.

Sethuramanujam et al. (2016) investigate the computational function of co-transmission of ACh
and GABA from SACs onto DSGCs, asking whether the excitatory/inhibitory transmitter mixture at
the same synapse has functional consequences beyond what single-transmitter models predict.
The study is conducted in rabbit retina across natural, low-contrast, and high-contrast visual
stimulation.

The authors combine whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from DSGCs with pharmacological
isolation of GABA, ACh, and glutamate receptor currents, a linear regression decomposition of
multi-component synaptic inputs, and optogenetic ChR2 activation of SACs while bipolar cell
input is silenced. These tools measure each transmitter contribution independently across
direction and contrast.

The central result is that ACh is the obligatory excitatory initiator at low contrast and
under natural stimuli, while glutamate through NMDA receptors acts as a dependent amplifier
via a nonlinear coincidence detection gate. Optogenetic isolation of the SAC network confirms
that SACs alone encode direction without upstream bipolar cell asymmetry. Both GABA and ACh
from SACs are direction-tuned, and their kinetic differences -- transient ACh vs. sustained
GABA -- contribute to the E/I asymmetry underlying direction selectivity.

For this project, the paper directly constrains the synaptic input parameterisation of a
compartmental DSGC model: cholinergic conductances must be direction-asymmetric and fast,
GABAergic conductances sustained and direction-asymmetric, and NMDA conductances
voltage-dependent with a contrast-dependent activation threshold. These constraints govern the
choice of AMPA, NMDA, and GABA-A conductance waveforms, their spatial distributions across the
dendritic arbor, and their directional weight asymmetries in the compartmental simulation.

Vlasits et al. (2016) address a longstanding question in retinal direction selectivity:
whether the *location* of excitatory inputs along a starburst amacrine cell dendrite matters,
separately from morphology and network inhibition. They combine four experimental techniques —
visual receptive field mapping with spots and rings, MNI-glutamate uncaging, PSD95-YFP genetic
labeling, and re-analysis of the Briggman et al. connectome — to show that excitatory bipolar
inputs are concentrated on the proximal ~70% of the SAC dendrite, while neurotransmitter
release sites (varicosities) occupy the distal third. Inputs and outputs are spatially
displaced.

Methodologically, the authors build a passive ball-and-stick NEURON model of a reconstructed
SAC dendrite and drive it with simulated moving bars under four synaptic-input distributions
matched in total synapse count and mean density but differing only in spatial placement: the
empirical skewed distribution and a symmetric full-length distribution, each in two variants.
This **morphology-matched symmetric-input control** isolates the effect of input geometry from
cable properties, producing a clean comparison that has become the reference design in the
field. Two-photon Ca2+ imaging of individual varicosities and pharmacological isolation of the
GABA-A component provide the in-tissue test of the model predictions.

The key finding is that the measured proximal-restricted input distribution produces robust
outward-motion-preferring voltage at the distal release zone (varicosity DSI = 0.34 ± 0.23, n
= 25), whereas a density-matched symmetric input distribution does not. Only ~25% of
DSGC-directed release sites overlap with the excitatory receptive field. GABA-A blockade with
gabazine reduces but does not abolish the computation, confirming that dendritic mechanisms
and circuit inhibition act synergistically. Adding voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to the
varicosities amplifies DS multiplicatively but is not required to generate it.

For this project literature survey on how morphology-driven models shape DS, Vlasits2016 is
the canonical reference for two reasons. First, it is the clearest demonstration that
synaptic-input spatial statistics are a morphology-independent degree of freedom that must be
respected by any compartmental DS model. Second, its morphology-matched symmetric-input design
is the methodological template we should import when our own tasks compare cable theory, input
placement, and active channels as DS determinants. Any compartmental SAC or DSGC model we
build that matches morphology alone but ignores input placement should be expected to
underestimate DS or distribute DS incorrectly across the dendrite, and the numerical targets
in this paper (varicosity DSI ~ 0.3, input field extending to ~70% of dendritic radius, ~25%
input-output overlap) are the benchmarks our simulations should hit.

Kim et al. answer a 50-year-old question about where direction selectivity arises in the
mammalian retina by combining dense electron-microscopy reconstruction with a minimal
mathematical model. Rather than attributing DS to biophysical properties of the SAC dendrite
itself (an earlier hypothesis that predicts the wrong preferred direction at the soma), they
propose that DS is built into the wiring diagram: BC types with slow visual responses synapse
near the SAC soma, BC types with fast responses synapse far from it, so outward motion
produces synchronous arrival of excitation along the dendrite and inward motion produces
asynchronous arrival.

The test is carried out on the e2198 mouse-retina SBEM dataset using a
deep-convolutional-network AI for voxel oversegmentation and a crowdsourced game, EyeWire, for
the neurite-agglomeration step. Paid lab workers and 5881 volunteer citizen-neuroscientists
reconstructed 79 Off SACs and 195 Off BC axons. Contact area between every BC-SAC pair was
computed, sorted by BC type and by distance from the SAC soma, and compared against a
co-stratification null model based on Peters Rule. The five Off BC types (BC1, BC2, BC3a,
BC3b, BC4) were classified by IPL-stratification profile and validated by mosaic regularity
and density.

The contact analysis reveals a sharp dichotomy: among the five Off BC types, only BC2
(proximal) and BC3a (distal) contact SACs substantially, and published two-photon calcium and
glutamate imaging show BC2 lags BC3a by 50-100 ms, exactly the sign and order required for
outward preferred direction. A linear-nonlinear model with a sustained (BC2) and a transient
biphasic (BC3a) subunit produces DS that subsumes Reichardt and Barlow-Levick detectors as
limiting cases, survives the isopotential-dendrite approximation (matching somatic
intracellular recordings), and suggests mammalian Off-SAC dendrites and *Drosophila* T4/T5
cells implement the same canonical motion operator. A subtle dendritic tilt through the IPL
(20-80 micrometre distance from soma) partially supports the wiring specificity but fails to
fully account for it, demonstrating quantitative violation of Peters Rule.

For the t0027 literature survey on morphology-driven DS modelling, Kim2014 is the canonical
connectome + anatomical-wiring input that every downstream compartmental DSGC/SAC model
(including Poleg-Polsky and Diamond 2026 work) consumes as its substrate. The paper is flagged
as borderline because it is primarily an EM + behavioural-model paper, not a morphology-sweep
paper: the morphology captured is the SAC stratification-depth profile and the BC2/BC3a
proximal/distal contact pattern, not a multi-compartment cable simulation. When reviewing
compartmental DS models, Kim2014 contact-vs-distance curves (Fig. 4d) should be treated as
ground-truth boundary conditions for the excitatory input spatial weighting, and the 50-100 ms
BC2-vs-BC3a lag as the ground-truth input-timing offset. Any compartmental model that cannot
reproduce this wiring is missing the principal mechanism of SAC DS as currently understood.

Park et al. (2014) investigate the synaptic basis of direction selectivity in mouse On-Off
DSGCs, asking whether acetylcholine and glutamate inputs are genuinely directionally tuned
alongside the well-established null-direction GABA from starburst amacrine cells. The study is
motivated by a decade of contradictory voltage-clamp data that appeared to show
preferred-direction-tuned excitatory conductances, implying DS presynaptic release from
bipolar cells and SAC cholinergic terminals.

The authors combine whole-cell patch-clamp with simultaneous two-photon imaging of iGluSnFR
conditionally expressed on DSGC dendrites via CART-Cre mice, applying pharmacological
manipulations (hexamethonium for nicotinic block, gabazine for GABA-A block). Recording the
optical glutamate signal and electrical conductance in the same cell at the same time allows
direct dissociation of presynaptic release directionality from voltage-clamp measurement
artefacts.

The central result is unambiguous: glutamate release lacks directional tuning (iGluSnFR P - N
= +0.073 +/- 0.04, p = 0.95) even while simultaneously recorded excitatory current appears
tuned (+0.35 +/- 0.07 nS, p = 0.00015). Blocking GABA-A receptors with gabazine abolishes
apparent excitatory DS in both modalities, confirming the artefact arises from imperfect space
clamp during strong null-direction inhibition (2.43 +/- 0.31 nS). The DS index of recorded
cells is 0.65 +/- 0.05, establishing a quantitative target for model optimisation.

For this project's compartmental simulation, these results provide three hard constraints: (1)
excitatory inputs (glutamate and acetylcholine) must be modelled as omnidirectional; (2) null-
direction GABA inhibition is the primary DS-generating mechanism with a P - N magnitude of
approximately 2.4 nS; and (3) the target DS index for optimisation is 0.65-0.73 under in vitro
patch-clamp conditions. The space-clamp artefact warns against using apparent excitatory
tuning in experimental voltage-clamp traces to calibrate any model excitatory tuning
parameter.

retina — the direction-selective response of ON-OFF DSGCs — and ask, at the cellular level,
*where* the selectivity is actually computed. Classical circuit models had concentrated on the
presynaptic starburst amacrine cell and on spatially offset GABAergic input to the DSGC. Prior
single-site recordings had been unable to resolve whether the DSGC itself simply passes along
its synaptic input or performs active, location-specific computation of its own. The authors
reframe the question by introducing dual simultaneous whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from
the DSGC soma and from individual terminal dendritic branches of the same cell, supplemented
by pharmacology (TTX, gabazine, QX-314) and a reconstructed-morphology compartmental
simulation.

Methodologically, the paper combines two-photon-guided patch-clamping of sub-micrometre
terminal dendrites with conventional visual stimulation of ON-OFF DSGCs, and with
voltage-clamp isolation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances. Dendritic spikes
are identified by their larger amplitude at the dendritic than at the somatic recording site
and by their temporal lead over the somatic action potential — the same criteria used in
canonical cortical dendritic-spike work. The compartmental model, fitted to passive responses
and endowed with distributed voltage-gated sodium and calcium conductances, is used to test
whether the experimental observations imply branch-level spike-initiation zones operating
quasi-independently.

The headline findings are that preferred-direction stimuli drive locally initiated dendritic
spikes in terminal branches which then propagate and boost the somatic drive, while
null-direction stimuli recruit GABAergic inhibition that acts at the same terminal branches to
veto spike initiation before it can escape to the soma. The direction-selectivity index is
close to 1 at the soma under control conditions, and this selectivity is almost entirely lost
when dendritic sodium spikes are blocked. The model reproduces these behaviours when terminal
dendrites carry physiologically plausible densities of voltage-gated sodium and calcium
channels and when inhibitory synaptic input is placed asymmetrically on the preferred-null
axis. Individual terminal branches behave as near-independent direction-selective subunits
whose outputs are pooled at the soma.

For this project literature survey on how morphology shapes DS via computational modelling,
Sivyer2013 sits at the boundary of the modelling bucket: it is primarily an experimental
dual-patch study, but its compartmental simulation supplies the mechanistic bridge between
dendritic geometry and DS computation. It is included with the explicit flag that
voltage-gated channel density is as decisive as branch geometry: morphology-only (passive)
models of DSGCs cannot reproduce the observations of this paper. Any DSGC model we build or
compare against in t0027 must jointly specify dendritic morphology *and* the densities of gNa
and gCa in terminal branches, and must treat terminal branches as quasi-independent
spike-initiation compartments with local GABAergic veto rather than as a single
electrotonically collapsed input.

This paper asks how a network of mouse retinal direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs)
combines weak electrical coupling, chemical synapses, and intrinsic membrane properties to
produce direction-tuned, anticipatory responses without runaway excitation. The motivation is
that earlier work (Trenholm et al. 2013, Nat. Neurosci.) had shown that the same
Hb9::eGFP-labelled superior- coding DSGCs perform "lag normalisation" - they detect a moving
edge at the same retinal location regardless of speed - but the mechanistic basis for the
asymmetric, leading-edge-skewed response underlying that computation was unknown.

The methodology pairs Neurobiotin tracer-coupling, two-photon-targeted whole-cell and
cell-attached patch-clamp from single and paired DSGCs, voltage- and current-clamp
characterisation of gap junctions (TTX, 18-beta-glycyrrhetinic acid), receptive-field mapping
with stationary spots and moving bars, and pharmacological dissection of GABAergic inhibition
with picrotoxin and intrinsic gain control with preconditioning current pulses. The key design
choice is to distinguish three mutually exclusive explanations for response skew -
gap-junction rectification, GABAergic inhibition, intrinsic gain control - and test each
independently.

The headline findings are: (i) only Hb9+ (superior-coding) DSGCs are strongly coupled, with ~1
nS symmetric reciprocal gap junctions and ~10 Hz low-pass filtering; (ii) gap junctions
provide a ~50-100 um subthreshold excitatory surround that primes coincident chemical synaptic
input, extending the effective receptive field and producing leading-edge-skewed motion
responses (SI **1.6 +/- 0.1** vs **1.1 +/- 0.1** in uncoupled cells); (iii) the leading-edge
skew survives picrotoxin in both preferred and null directions, ruling out GABA as the sole
cause; (iv) preconditioning spike trains attenuate initial-response spikes by **70 +/- 6%**
and abolish skew, with **tau ~604 ms** recovery, implicating activity-dependent intrinsic gain
control as the dominant rectifying mechanism. Reported peak rates are **198 +/- 14 Hz**
(preferred, control), **27 +/- 12 Hz** (null, control), and **244 +/- 18 Hz** / **202 +/- 14
Hz** under picrotoxin.

For this project, the paper is a primary literature anchor for the firing-rate target of
Hb9::eGFP mouse DSGCs and clarifies a critical interpretation issue: the project
domain-knowledge "30-80 Hz" preferred-direction figure most likely originates from mean /
trial-averaged rates (consistent with Rivlin-Etzion et al. 2012's ~10 Hz), whereas this
paper's 198 Hz preferred and 27 Hz null are peak rates from Gaussian-convolved spike trains,
and the corresponding peak-rate DSI is 0.76. The MOBO objective for the AIS-tiered AHP task
should explicitly state which metric (peak vs mean) it targets to avoid mixing scales. The
paper also constrains AIS / soma model choices: a realistic Hb9 DSGC model needs slow (~600
ms) intrinsic gain control (Na slow inactivation or Ca-activated K), spatially offset GABA
inhibition (~52 um null-side, E_GABA near -60 mV), and weak symmetric reciprocal gap-junction
coupling - all properties that bias which ion-channel parameter sets and AHP regimes can
simultaneously hit the peak-rate target and the DSI target.

Rivlin-Etzion, Wei, and Feller (2012, Neuron) ask whether the direction-selective response of
mouse ON-OFF retinal ganglion cells is rigidly determined by the asymmetric SAC-DSGC wiring
revealed by EM reconstruction, or whether it can be reshaped by recent visual experience.
Their work targets the dominant "hardwired retina" view of direction selectivity and tests it
directly by applying brief drifting-grating adaptation protocols and measuring whether DSGC
preferred direction remains stable.

The methodology combines two-photon-targeted loose-patch recordings from genetically labelled
posterior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs (DRD4-GFP and TRHR-GFP lines, P14-P88, both sexes) with
whole-cell voltage clamp to dissect synaptic mechanisms, plus pharmacology with gabazine to
test GABA-A involvement and L-AP4 to test ON-pathway involvement. Directional tuning is
quantified with DSI and vector-sum metrics computed from 3 s grating responses in 12
directions, using a pre/adaptation/post design with four adaptation protocols (P-N, Null, P-O,
counter-phase) plus a no-stimulus control.

The authors find that drifting-grating adaptation can fully reverse the PD of a substantial
fraction of ON-OFF DSGCs (41% of 74 cells across protocols) and that this reversal is robust,
long-lasting (persisting up to 23 min), GABA-A dependent, and mediated by a redistribution of
asymmetric inhibition rather than by new wiring. ON-pathway crossover circuits are necessary
for the reversal: L-AP4 blockade reduces reversal probability and reveals a delayed OFF
response normally masked by the ON pathway. Critically, the paper reports paired DSI plus mean
preferred-direction firing rate from the same cells: **DSI 0.78 +/- 0.19 with mean PD rate
10.38 +/- 8.53 Hz** for stable cells (n = 8\) and **DSI 0.63 +/- 0.23 with 9.95 +/- 5.42 Hz**
for reversed cells (n = 8), measured over the 3 s grating window.

For task t0078, this paper is the primary literature anchor for revising the project's pass
criterion from "PD rate >= 30 Hz" to "PD rate >= 10 Hz". The previously assumed 30-80 Hz mean
PD firing rate range conflated peak rates over sub-second windows with mean rates over
multi-second windows; this paper establishes that the mean PD firing rate of mouse ON-OFF
DSGCs is approximately 10 Hz when measured over a 3 s window, with paired DSI of 0.78. The
result also informs the Bayesian-optimisation utopia point used to compute hypervolume in
t0078 and downstream model selection. A secondary implication for downstream tasks is that
DSGC tuning is plastic on a minutes timescale, so model-fitting tasks should treat
pre-adaptation values as the canonical target and not aggregate them with post-adaptation
states.

This 2012 Nature Reviews Neuroscience article by Vaney, Sivyer and Taylor is the standard
decadal synthesis of retinal direction selectivity. Its research question is how the retina -
within two synapses of the photoreceptors - produces ganglion cells whose spike output prefers
one direction of image motion, and in particular how the three Barlow-Levick computational
ingredients (spatial asymmetry, nonlinearity, time delay) are implemented at the cellular
level. The scope covers On-Off DSGCs, On DSGCs and Off DSGCs in rabbit, rat and mouse, with
the microcircuit-level focus on starburst amacrine cells and bipolar cells as the presynaptic
substrate and on DSGC dendrites as the postsynaptic substrate.

The synthesis is built from four data streams. Morphological work (dye fills, SBF-EM,
Neurobiotin-tracer coupling) defines the bistratified DSGC dendritic geometry and the SAC
mosaic. Pharmacology (GABA_A and nicotinic antagonists) and paired cell recordings pin down
which transmitters and which sides of the SAC carry the directional signal. Calcium imaging of
SAC dendrites under apparent-motion paradigms establishes that individual SAC dendrites are
themselves DS units whose calcium transients are biased toward centrifugal motion.
Developmental experiments (intravitreal GABA and cholinergic drugs, dark-rearing, TTX) show
that the direction-selective wiring is essentially hard-wired.

The headline findings are that null-side SAC-to-DSGC GABAergic inhibition is **~9x larger** in
conductance and **~11x more numerous** in synapses than the preferred-side input, that
cholinergic SAC-to-DSGC excitation is spatially symmetric, and that DSGC dendrites carry
voltage-gated self-propagating dendritic spikes that are immune to shunting by intervening
inhibition once initiated. The authors also raise a provocative methodological caveat - that
reported directional asymmetries in DSGC excitatory currents may reflect somatic voltage-clamp
errors on electrotonically extended dendrites rather than genuine DS glutamatergic or
cholinergic inputs. This leaves the relative pre- vs post-synaptic contributions to the final
spike output partially unresolved.

For this project the review is foundational. It fixes the cell type (On-Off DSGC), the minimum
biophysical geometry (bistratified dendrites, ~150-200 micrometre dendritic field per
sublamina, ~40 micrometre subunit spacing), the dominant directional input (asymmetric
null-side GABAergic inhibition, symmetric cholinergic and glutamatergic excitation), and the
post-synaptic nonlinearity (dendritic spikes). It directly informs Research Question 1
(somatic Na/K conductance combinations must still support spiking under large null-direction
inhibitory conductances), Research Question 3 (AMPA/GABA input density should be calibrated
against the ~9:1 null/preferred IPSC amplitude and isotropic EPSC), and Research Question 4
(active vs passive dendrites should be compared against the dendritic-spike substrate the
authors endorse). Its voltage-clamp-error argument is a direct caution against over-fitting to
published excitatory-current directionality.

Briggman, Helmstaedter, and Denk (2011) address whether direction selectivity in mouse On-Off
DSGCs requires a structural wiring asymmetry or merely functional differences in synapse
strength within an anatomically symmetric circuit. Prior patch-clamp studies had established
that inhibitory input from SACs is asymmetric -- stronger from null-side SACs -- but could not
determine whether this reflected more contacts or stronger individual synapses, nor whether
SAC dendrite orientation rather than soma location was the relevant factor.

The authors first used two-photon calcium imaging with OGB-1 to identify preferred directions
of 25 On-Off DSGCs in a 300 x 300 um mouse retinal region, then fixed the identical tissue and
acquired a 60 x 350 x 300 um SBEM volume at 16.5 x 16.5 x 23 nm resolution. Manual skeleton
tracing in KNOSSOS yielded 6 DSGC and 24 SAC dendritic trees; 831 putative SAC-to-DSGC
synapses were annotated at varicose contact sites and confirmed by ultrastructural criteria.

The data reveal a striking structural asymmetry: SAC dendrites oriented antiparallel to a DSGC
preferred direction preferentially form synapses with that cell (mean dendrite-to-null angle
165.2 +/- 51.7 degrees; 524 vs. 41 synapses from null vs. preferred-side somata, ~12.8:1).
Critically, when soma-soma axis and dendrite orientation conflict, dendrite orientation wins:
connected dendrites run 24.3 +/- 2.8 degrees closer to the null axis, confirming individual
SAC branches as independent synaptic selectors.

For this project compartmental DSGC model, these data establish the structural baseline for
inhibitory input placement: asymmetric by dendrite orientation, concentrated from
null-direction SAC branches distributed across the full DSGC dendritic field. Any model using
spatially uniform inhibitory placement or relying solely on weight asymmetry is inconsistent
with this structural evidence. The paper also directly cites Schachter et al. (2010), a
computational DSGC model in which dendritic spikes amplify SAC-derived inhibition, connecting
this anatomy paper directly to the biophysical modelling literature this project builds upon.

Hoshi et al. (2011) demonstrate that the rabbit ON DS ganglion cell population, treated as a
single type for decades, actually comprises two distinct subtypes separable on six independent
criteria: tracer-coupling pattern, IPL stratification depth, dendritic branching complexity,
response latency, temporal transience, and cholinergic pharmacology. The study uses targeted
acridine-orange-guided recording and intracellular Neurobiotin/Lucifer Yellow injection in
isolated rabbit retinas, characterising 45-52 cells of each subtype -- the largest systematic
ON DS morphology-physiology dataset at the time of publication.

The uncoupled (sustained) subtype ramifies within the ON cholinergic band (~77% IPL depth),
cofasciculates with starburst amacrine dendrites, fires with long latency (381 ms peak) and
sustained character, is never tracer-coupled, and responds strongly to nicotine -- consistent
with the starburst-GABA direction-selectivity model. The coupled (transient) subtype
stratifies distal to the ChAT band (~57% IPL depth), does not cofasciculate with starburst
processes, fires with short latency (71 ms) and transient character, is gap-junction coupled
to 60-190 GABA-positive amacrine cells, and shows minimal nicotine sensitivity -- implying a
non-starburst directional mechanism.

Key quantitative findings: retroflexive terminal processes 14.7 vs. 2.4 (t(94) = 14.52, p <
0.001), dendritic self-crossings 16.5 vs. 4.6 (t(94) = 11.71, p < 0.001), stratification 57%
vs. 77% IPL depth (~3 um separation, confirmed 100% in direct crossings), and response latency
70.7 vs. 381.0 ms (p < 0.01). The two morphological measures together produce complete
population separation across 96 cells. Despite these mechanistic differences, both subtypes
produce equivalent directional output: three cardinal preferred axes, ~100 um/s preferred
velocity, and DSI ~0.66-0.67.

For the current project modelling a single ON DSGC compartmentally and optimising against a
target angle-to-AP-frequency tuning curve, this paper provides essential morphological
constraints. The uncoupled (sustained) subtype -- with high dendritic density, stratification
within the starburst band, and starburst-GABA input geometry -- is the appropriate target cell
type. Key validation benchmarks: DSI ~0.66, preferred velocity ~100 um/s, peak response
latency ~381 ms, stratification at ~77% IPL depth, eccentricity-area slope 0.0605 mm2/mm.
These constrain the morphology, wave- stimulus parameters, and response targets for
compartmental simulation.

Fohlmeister, Cohen, and Newman ask how ion channels are distributed across the dendrites,
soma, initial segment, and axon of rat and cat retinal ganglion cells, and how that
distribution must be scaled with temperature to reproduce whole-cell action-potential trains
across 7-37 C. The question matters because single-compartment or under-constrained
multicompartment models of RGCs have historically suffered from parameter degeneracy: many
G-bar maps can fit a recording at one temperature, and the community lacked a principled,
temperature-transferable channel set.

Methodologically, the authors record repetitive spiking in anatomically reconstructed rat Type
I and Type II and cat alpha and beta RGCs at multiple temperatures, then fit phase plots
(dV/dt versus V) of each cell with NEURON multicompartment simulations of the
Fohlmeister-Miller Five-channel model (Na, K(DR), Ca, K(A), K(Ca)). The crucial design choice
is to demand that a single G-bar map fit every temperature simultaneously, so temperature
becomes an identifiability lever, and to separate gating-kinetic Q10s from ion-permeability
Q10s in a GHK-style current equation.

They find that the voltage dependence of rate constants is constant within 7-23 C and within
30-37 C with a sharp transition at 23-30 C; that gating Q10s are ~1.9-1.95 and permeability
Q10s are ~1.5-1.65 above 23 C but climb toward ~8 below 10 C; and that Na channels become
non-Arrhenius below 8 C, with spike failure below 7 C. Peak Na conductance is concentrated on
a thin axonal segment 50-130 um distal to the soma (up to 448 mS/cm^2 in cat alpha), and the
temperature dependence of the IS-SD phase-plot break confirms this localization. A single
cell-type-specific channel map fits all temperatures.

For this project, which is building DSGC compartmental models, this paper is foundational: it
provides a fully calibrated, temperature-scaled Five-channel parameter set for retinal
ganglion cells in rat and cat, including the Na hotspot location, the dendritic Na+K(A) safety
factor, and the two-plateau temperature-scaling scheme. The G-bar tables and Q10 values should
be adopted as the default channel-density prior for DSGC models, modified only where
DSGC-specific evidence demands it, and the phase-plot fitting methodology should be used to
calibrate DSGC compartmental models against future whole-cell recordings.

Schachter, Oesch, Smith & Taylor (2010) ask how the rabbit On-Off direction-selective ganglion
cell converts weakly directionally tuned synaptic input (PSP DSI ~0.2) into strongly tuned
spike output (spike DSI ~0.8). The scope is a single-cell biophysical explanation: given the
known circuitry (starburst amacrine cells providing presynaptic DS, spatially offset
postsynaptic inhibition) and the known cell (anatomical DSGC morphology with active
dendrites), can the measured transformation be reproduced, and what is each mechanism
contribution? This is motivated by prior in vitro evidence from Oesch et al. (2005) that each
somatic spike is triggered by a dendritic spike, and by the unresolved question of whether
postsynaptic inhibition alone can account for DS.

The methodology is a NeuronC compartmental simulation of a reconstructed DSGC with
Hodgkin-Huxley Na, Kv, Kv4, and Ca channels in the dendrites and soma, driven by AMPA-like
excitatory and GABA-A-like inhibitory synapses whose conductances and timings match published
voltage-clamp data. Stimulation protocols include single-synapse threshold mapping, paired
excitation+inhibition titration, and full 12-direction drifting-bar experiments. Key design
decisions include electrically compartmentalizing the dendrites via high Rm and thin distal
branches (Rin >1 GOhm), using uniform or graded dendritic gNa (**40 mS/cm^2** or **45 to 20
mS/cm^2**), and systematically removing each DS mechanism to isolate its contribution.

The headline results are that local dendritic spike thresholds act as ~4x nonlinear amplifiers
of PSP-level DS; that physiological inhibition (**~4-10 nS**) can prevent spike initiation but
cannot block propagation (which would require ~85 nS); that presynaptic DS from SACs is the
more robust mechanism across the arbor while postsynaptic inhibition dominates only at distal
tips; and that an intrinsic dendritic geometric effect actually opposes the desired DS on the
preferred side, requiring network DS to be strong enough to overcome it. Somatic voltage-clamp
additionally underestimates distal conductances by 40-100%.

For the present project compartmental modeling of DSGCs, this paper provides a concrete
reference design (channel densities, synapse conductances, inhibition placement, morphology
source) and three load-bearing predictions to reproduce: (i) the 4x amplification of DSI from
PSPs to spikes via dendritic Na, (ii) the initiation-vs-propagation asymmetry for inhibition,
and (iii) the compartmentalized-subunit structure of the tree. It also establishes that
presynaptic DS cannot be omitted from a DSGC model intended to match physiological spike
tuning and gives quantitative guidance on how to calibrate voltage-clamp-derived conductances
for use in simulation.

The paper asks why two morphologically distinct direction-selective ganglion cells in the
rabbit retina, the bistratified ON-OFF DSGC and the monostratified ON DSGC, have different
velocity tuning despite sharing the same directional computation. Using a combined
extracellular-spiking and whole-cell voltage-clamp protocol in the isolated rabbit retina, the
authors record spiking direction-velocity tuning and then isolate the light-evoked excitatory
and inhibitory synaptic conductances under voltage clamp at the chloride and cation reversal
potentials respectively.

Methodologically, the work is an application of the now-standard two-conductance decomposition
to a velocity-tuning question: the same drifting-grating and local-flicker stimuli are
presented under current- and voltage-clamp, and conductances are computed from
holding-potential-dependent currents while sodium channels are blocked with intracellular
QX-314. Direction tuning is quantified with a DSI and von Mises kappa; temporal tuning is
quantified by measuring the peak excitatory and inhibitory conductances as a function of
temporal frequency. Cell types are confirmed post hoc by dye-fill morphology to ensure that
reported differences are not confounded by misclassification.

The central finding is that the direction-selective mechanism itself is identical in the two
cell types (preferred-side excitation, null-side inhibition, with GI,N/GI,P around 3.4 and
GE,P/GE,N around 1.6) but that the velocity bandwidth differs because the ON DSGC receives a
transient inhibitory conductance that precedes a slower sustained excitatory conductance, and
the ratio of inhibition to excitation grows with temporal frequency. In ON-OFF DSGCs, by
contrast, both conductances are approximately flat from 0.5 to 8 Hz, producing the broad
velocity response for which these cells are known.

For this project, the paper is load-bearing because it converts the qualitative statement that
ON DSGCs prefer slow motion into a quantitative recipe for the inputs of a compartmental
model: spatially asymmetric preferred/null conductance ratios, temporally mismatched rise and
decay kinetics, and a specific lead-lag offset between inhibition and excitation. These
constraints directly inform both the EPSP/IPSP amplitude-and-kinetics sweep and the
wave-stimulus protocol described in the project scope, and supply a matched ON vs ON-OFF
comparison framework against which the model velocity-tuning output can be validated.

Chen et al. (2009) investigate the electrophysiology of ON-OFF direction-selective retinal
ganglion cells across postnatal development in the C57BL/6N mouse, asking when directional
computation first appears and whether visual experience shapes its development. Using
whole-cell patch clamp in the isolated retina, they record from DSGCs at P11, P13, P18, and
adulthood, and test mice reared in complete darkness from P0-P11 and P0-P30.

The approach combines loose-patch identification (DSI > 0.3 threshold), whole-cell
voltage-clamp for EPSC kinetics at -65 mV and 0 mV, and current-clamp for excitability and
directional tuning curves (12 directions, 30-degree spacing, bar 100 um x 500 um at
approximately 750 um/s). Cells were morphologically confirmed as bistratified ON-OFF DSGCs by
intracellular dye fills.

The central result is a developmental dissociation: spike counts are roughly half adult values
at P11 (ON: **21.2 +/- 4.4** vs adult **42.9 +/- 5.1 spikes**; peak rate **95.9** vs **166.4
Hz**), EPSC kinetics are significantly slower (*p* < 0.0001), and synaptic reliability is
markedly reduced -- yet DSI and tuning-curve half-width are adult-equivalent at all ages (*p*
> 0.05). Dark rearing does not alter directional tuning, confirming the circuit is fully
light-independent.

For this project, Chen et al. (2009) supply the primary empirical validation target. The
quantitative tuning metrics (DSI, half-width) from the standardised 12-direction protocol
define the target angle-to-AP-frequency relationship the compartmental model must reproduce.
The specific stimulus parameters should be replicated verbatim in the model wave protocol. The
robustness of directional tuning to excitability variations motivates sensitivity analyses in
which somatic Na/K conductances are varied widely without expecting the tuning curve to
collapse.

Margolis and Detwiler take a direct experimental approach to the question of whether retinal
ganglion cell maintained activity is synaptically driven or intrinsically generated. Using
whole-cell and cell-attached patch-clamp recordings from morphologically identified ON and OFF
RGCs in rabbit retinal wholemount, they compare maintained firing under control conditions to
firing after pharmacological blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The design cleanly
separates synaptic drive from intrinsic biophysics in the same cells.

The methodology is careful about cell identification and blockade efficacy, and the follow-up
experiments extend the comparison beyond maintained firing to other signatures of pacemaker
activity: subthreshold oscillations, burst firing, and rebound excitation. Each signature is a
distinct testable claim about the cell intrinsic biophysics, not a single measurement.

The headline finding is that ON and OFF RGCs use qualitatively different strategies. ON cells
require synaptic input to fire at rest; OFF cells fire autonomously and additionally show the
full suite of pacemaker properties. The difference is not explained by passive properties but
by different voltage-gated channel complements, a conclusion supported by the pattern of
intrinsic responses.

For this project, the implications matter even though the paper is about pure ON and OFF cells
rather than DSGCs directly. ON-OFF DSGCs integrate both input streams, and the biophysics of
the OFF input pathway may bring some of the intrinsic-pacemaker machinery into the DSGC soma
and dendrites. DSGC compartmental models should consider whether burst firing, rebound
excitation, and subthreshold oscillations are expected behaviours of the target cell and
include or exclude the relevant voltage-gated channels (T-type Ca2+, HCN) accordingly. Using
maintained-activity-under-synaptic-blockade as a model validation target cleanly separates the
intrinsic biophysics from the synaptic drive, and that separation should be part of our
modelling workflow.

Oesch, Euler, and Taylor address a central unresolved question in retinal direction
selectivity: why does a ganglion cell whose somatic subthreshold EPSPs are only weakly
directional produce spike output that is sharply tuned to the preferred direction of motion?
By combining whole-cell current-clamp recordings from ON-OFF DSGCs in flat-mounted rabbit
retina with focal and dendritic TTX application, intracellular QX-314, controlled somatic
hyperpolarization, and two-photon Ca2+ imaging of dendritic arbors, they dissect the spatial
origin of the spikes that drive DSGC output during visual stimulation.

The headline finding is a bimodal spike amplitude distribution - large ~55 mV somatic action
potentials and small ~7 mV dendritic spikelets - that can be separated by any of three
independent manipulations (somatic TTX, QX-314, somatic hyperpolarization). The dendritic
spikelets inherit the full directional tuning of the somatic output (DSI ~0.6-0.7),
superimpose at sub-somatic-refractory intervals, and are selectively suppressed by puffing TTX
onto the dendrites (reducing light-evoked spikes by ~42% while barely affecting
depolarization-evoked somatic spikes). Calcium imaging confirms that the dendrites host
functional TTX-sensitive Na+ channels active during light-driven responses.

Mechanistically, the authors argue that direction selectivity is computed by dendritic spike
failure: locally offset GABAergic inhibition from starburst amacrine cells, positioned between
bipolar-cell excitation and the soma along the null-direction pathway, shunts dendritic spikes
before they can reach the soma. In the preferred direction the inhibition is distal to the
excitation, so dendritic spikes propagate successfully. This model naturally explains the
nondirectional zone on the preferred side of the receptive field and the preferred-side
receptive field offset.

For a DSGC compartmental modeling project, this paper is foundational. It supplies the
quantitative targets (somatic PSP amplitudes of ~12 mV across all directions, somatic
threshold near -49 mV, dendritic spikelet amplitude ~7 mV, spike DSI ~0.7 versus PSP DSI ~0.1)
that any biophysical simulation must reproduce, and it specifies the qualitative requirements:
active dendrites with distributed Na+ channels, multiple independent initiation zones,
on-the-path starburst inhibition, and a near-unity dendritic-to-somatic spike coupling. Any
model that relies on passive dendrites and a single somatic threshold cannot reach the
observed tuning sharpness and should be rejected on quantitative grounds.

Taylor and Vaney (2002) ask whether direction selectivity in rabbit On-Off DSGCs arises from
directional upstream circuitry (presynaptic), from local postsynaptic E/I interactions in the
dendrites, or from a combination of both. The motivation is to resolve a contradiction between
their own 2000 study (postsynaptic conclusion) and a contemporaneous turtle study (presynaptic
conclusion), using a more complete conductance analysis in rabbit retina.

The approach is whole-cell voltage clamp in whole-mount retina with cesium-gluconate and
QX-314 to block intrinsic voltage-gated currents, enabling linear I-V relationships from which
synaptic conductance and reversal potential are extracted every 10 ms across 9 holding
potentials. Excita- tory and inhibitory conductances are isolated by two-component
decomposition at assigned reversal potentials (Ve ~0 mV, Vi ~-65 mV). Spatial offsets of
inhibition are computed from inter- direction timing differences of conductance peaks,
assuming centred receptive fields.

Three mechanisms are found to coexist: preferred-direction excitation (**1.66x** on, **1.36x**
off), null-direction inhibition (**3.31x** on, **1.40x** off), and a **160 um** postsynaptic
spatial offset of off-inhibition with no equivalent in the on-arbor. The on-arbor relies
chiefly on the two presynaptic asymmetries; the off-arbor additionally uses the postsynaptic
spatial offset. Total conductance is nearly balanced across directions (~118% null/preferred),
because directional excitation and inhibition partially cancel. Both subarbors achieve
identical directional tuning (D ~0.56) through distinct mechanisms, demonstrating
within-neuron functional heterogeneity.

For this project, Taylor and Vaney (2002) is the primary empirical anchor for synaptic input
parameters in the DSGC compartmental model. The null/preferred Gi ratios (**3.31x** on,
**1.40x** off) constrain the inhibitory conductance asymmetry that the model must reproduce.
The 160 um inhibitory spatial offset in the off-subarbor specifies the spatial profile of
inhibitory synapse placement. The push-pull E/I structure implies both excitatory and
inhibitory conductances must be directionally modulated. The large cell-to-cell variability
justifies treating E/I ratios as free parameters in the optimisation, bounded by the reported
means and standard deviations.

Barlow and Levick investigate the mechanism of direction selectivity in on-off retinal
ganglion cells of the rabbit. The central question is what intraretinal circuit produces the
striking asymmetry between vigorous preferred-direction responses and near-silence for
null-direction motion, given that this asymmetry cannot be explained by the static on/off
receptive field map.

The experimental strategy combines systematic exclusion of alternative hypotheses with
two-spot temporal sequence experiments. Optical aberrations and latency gradients are ruled
out first. Single-slit experiments localise the full DS mechanism to subunits of 6-24
arc-minutes, replicated uniformly across the 3-4.5 degree receptive field. Two-spot
experiments show that these subunits discriminate the temporal order of excitation of pairs of
neighbouring regions, with the effect present only within approximately 24 arc-minutes.

The key finding is that null-direction selectivity is produced by active inhibition: null
sequences elicit fewer spikes than the sum of individual responses (Table 3), while preferred
sequences produce a small facilitation. The inhibitory mechanism is proposed to arise from
horizontal cells conducting laterally in the null direction to veto bipolar responses. The
specific cell-type assignment was later revised to starburst amacrine cells, but the logical
architecture has proven correct.

For this project, Barlow1965 provides the primary behavioural benchmark for the compartmental
model: it must fire vigorously for preferred-direction waves and be nearly silent for
null-direction waves, with asymmetry arising from spatially distributed inhibitory GABA
synaptic input across the dendritic arbor. The inhibitory interaction range constraint
(approximately 0.25-1 degree) bounds the spatial scale of GABA inputs, and the optimal wave
speed of approximately 5 degrees/sec sets the target velocity for parametric sweeps in
simulation.

No. Every per-synapse-class summed peak conductance at the code-pinned gNMDA = 0.5 nS is 6-9x
the paper's Fig 3A-E target on the summed scale and well below it on the per-synapse-mean
scale, so neither interpretation reconciles. DSI as a function of gNMDA peaks at 0.19 near
b2gnmda = 0.5 nS and decays toward zero by 3.0 nS, never crossing the paper's claimed flat
~0.30 band. The extended noise sweep shows DSI declining qualitatively as flickerVAR rises in
the control and 0Mg conditions but the trend is weaker than the paper reports, and the ROC AUC
metric saturates at 1.0 across every cell because PSP peaks dwarf baselines on this circuit.

0.04-0.10 across the entire range, not at 0.30. The Voff_bipNMDA = 1 swap by itself does not
reproduce the paper's DSI vs gNMDA claim.

Partially. The from-scratch port of ModelDB 189347 reproduces the qualitative direction-tuning
behaviour (PD PSP > ND PSP) and the predicted suppression of selectivity under 0 Mg2+, but the
absolute PSP amplitudes are larger than the paper's reported means at the code-pinned gNMDA =

<summary><strong>What variables of neuronal morphology have been shown by

[`morphology-direction-selectivity-modeling-synthesis`](../../tasks/t0027_literature_survey_morphology_ds_modeling/assets/answer/morphology-direction-selectivity-modeling-synthesis/)

Computational models have shown that direction selectivity is shaped by dendritic length,
branch-order and branching pattern, dendritic diameter (especially in starburst amacrine
cells), spatial layout and kinetic tiling of bipolar-cell inputs, asymmetric arbors and plexus
density, and the electrotonic compartmentalization of terminal branches. The load-bearing
mechanisms are passive cable filtering with transfer-resistance weighting of distributed
inputs, local-global EPSP summation along soma-to-tip dendritic gradients, space-time input
tiling (sustained proximal, transient distal), dendritic-spike branch independence driven by
voltage-gated Na and Ca channels, and asymmetric SAC-to-DSGC inhibition constrained by
morphology. Gaps remain in systematic sweeps of branch order and dendritic diameter on
realistic reconstructions, in joint manipulation of morphology with active conductances at
DSGC tips, and in morphology-aware modeling of cortical and invertebrate direction selectivity
beyond the retina.

Yes, ModelDB 189347 was ported and runs headless on Windows 11 with NEURON 8.2.7 via a Python
driver that sources the verbatim HOC and MOD files through `h.load_file`/`h.nrn_load_dll`; a
12-angle x 20-trial sweep on the bundled morphology completed end-to-end in roughly 10 minutes
and the four registered metrics (DSI, HWHM, reliability, RMSE vs target) were written to
`results/metrics.json`. The tuning curve does not hit the published envelope at the bundled
parameters (peak well below 40 Hz, DSI well below 0.7), because the paper derives DS from a
`gabaMOD` parameter swap rather than from spatial rotation — the port's rotation-based
protocol is only a proxy for a direction- selective stimulus. The Hanson et al. 2019
Spatial-Offset-DSGC model (GitHub `geoffder/Spatial-Offset-DSGC-NEURON-Model`) is the
next-best port candidate: it shares `RGCmodel.hoc` and `HHst.mod` with 189347 and already
ships a Python driver; Jain 2020 is medium-effort; Ding 2016, Schachter 2010, Koren 2017, and
Ezra-Tsur 2022 either lack a public compartmental model or address a different modelling

the t0002 corpus but had never been ported. None of the three HIGH-priority candidates
completed a 12-angle canonical sweep within the 90-minute-per-candidate port budget — each
failed at the P2 upstream-demo gate for a different structural reason (Hanson: headfull Python
driver with hardcoded Windows paths; deRosenroll: hardcoded 8-direction stimulus grid plus
heavy out-of-env dependencies; Poleg-Polsky: genetic-algorithm training driver with `numDir=2`
and no LICENSE). Zero library assets were registered per the "never leave a broken library
behind" rule, and all three candidates are recorded as `p2_failed` in `data/candidates.csv`.
Deeper investment (hand-rewriting each driver) would very plausibly succeed; the 90-minute cap

<summary><strong>What does the patch-clamp / voltage-clamp / space-clamp literature

[`patch-clamp-techniques-and-constraints-for-dsgc-modelling`](../../tasks/t0017_literature_survey_patch_clamp/assets/answer/patch-clamp-techniques-and-constraints-for-dsgc-modelling/)

DSGC compartmental models must treat published somatic voltage-clamp Ge/Gi traces as lower
bounds on distal dendritic conductances rather than ground truth, because up to ~80% of the
synaptic signal is lost on thin distal dendrites even in passive cables and active dendritic
channels add further error. The modelling pipeline therefore needs a simulated somatic
voltage-clamp block that mimics the experimental amplifier so simulation and experiment are
compared on the same footing. The model must include an explicit AIS compartment with Nav1.6
enrichment at approximately 7x the somatic Na+ density, with AIS length as a named tunable
parameter constrained by immunohistochemistry, and NMDARs with standard Mg2+ block kinetics on
DSGC dendrites, fit to AMPA/NMDA charge ratios during preferred and null motion rather than
peak-AMPA-current alone. Finally the modeller must decide explicitly whether to include
intrinsic-pacemaker biophysics (T-type Ca2+, HCN, subthreshold oscillations) based on the
target DSGC subtype, validated by maintained-activity-under-synaptic-blockade traces.

[`synaptic-integration-priors-for-dsgc-modelling`](../../tasks/t0018_literature_survey_synaptic_integration/assets/answer/synaptic-integration-priors-for-dsgc-modelling/)

Receptor kinetics: AMPA uses a fast bi-exponential conductance (rise ~0.2 ms, decay ~1-3 ms,
Erev 0 mV); NMDA uses a slow conductance (rise ~5-10 ms, decay ~50-100 ms, Erev 0 mV) with
Jahr-Stevens Mg2+ block; GABA_A uses a fast bi-exponential (rise ~0.5 ms, decay ~5-10 ms, Erev
-65 to -75 mV). Shunting inhibition vetoes excitation multiplicatively with an "on-the-path"
geometry: only inhibition sitting between the excitatory input and the soma shunts PSP
amplitude, while distal inhibition has negligible effect. Excitation and inhibition co-tune in
time with inhibition lagging excitation by ~1-3 ms in cortex and ~15-50 ms in DSGCs during
null-direction motion, sharpening spike timing. Somatic PSP amplitude decays roughly
exponentially with electrotonic distance (lambda_DC ~100-300 um for RGC dendrites) while local
dendritic non-linearities (Na+, Ca2+, NMDAR) partially compensate for distal attenuation. SAC
boutons onto a DSGC dendrite are spatially asymmetric with stronger inhibition from null-side
SACs, and this cellular asymmetry (not somatic E-I timing alone) is the primary substrate for
direction selectivity at the DSGC level.

[`nav-kv-combinations-for-dsgc-modelling`](../../tasks/t0019_literature_survey_voltage_gated_channels/assets/answer/nav-kv-combinations-for-dsgc-modelling/)

RGC AIS Nav subunits segregate into microdomains with Nav1.6 concentrated distally and Nav1.2
enriched proximally, and Kv1.1/Kv1.2 co-localising with Nav1.6 in the distal AIS.
AIS-localised Kv1 channels activate near threshold (V_half around -40 to -50 mV) with
sub-millisecond kinetics and control AP waveform and somatic repolarisation. The
Fohlmeister-Miller RGC HH kinetics provide canonical alpha/beta rate functions for Nav and Kv
at 22 degC with Nav activation V_half near -40 mV and a Q10 near 3 for warming to 37 degC.
Nav1.6 activates about 10-15 mV more negative than Nav1.2, so distal Nav1.6 initiates the AP
while proximal Nav1.2 supports backpropagation into the soma. Peak AIS Nav conductance density
is about 2500-5000 pS/um2 (roughly 50x somatic density), an order-of-magnitude prior essential
for reproducing fast, reliable AP initiation in compartmental models.

The literature structures the five questions around a small set of quantitative targets that
the project must hit. For Na/K conductances the Fohlmeister-Miller parameter set (peak somatic
g_Na around 0.04-0.10 S/cm^2, delayed-rectifier g_K around 0.012 S/cm^2) is the standard
starting point, and no published paper reports a factorial (g_Na, g_K) grid for DSGCs. For
morphology the asymmetric ON-OFF DSGC dendrite is sharply wired in the null direction through
SAC-mediated inhibition, yet global dendrite shape only minimally changes the synaptic map
while local electrotonic compartments still matter. For AMPA/GABA balance the canonical counts
on a reconstructed mouse DSGC are 177 AMPA and 177 GABA synapses, with null-direction
inhibition running three to five times larger than preferred inhibition. Active dendrites with
Fohlmeister-like channel densities roughly double the direction-selectivity index versus
passive trees, and the target mouse ON-OFF DSGC tuning curve should hit DSI 0.7-0.85,
preferred peak 40-80 Hz, null residual under 10 Hz, and a half-width of 60-90 degrees.

output before launching the full MOBO. Budget: 18-36 h Vast.ai EPYC at $0.30/h, total $5-11.
MI is post-hoc on simulation output, so cost overhead is mostly in extra population to
populate the MI Pareto direction. Priority dropped to medium pending recipe validation.

Decouples function (information) from selectivity (DSI). Produces a bits-per-ATP Pareto front
directly comparable to Niven et al. 2007's empirical fly-photoreceptor 200-1000 bits/s
super-linear cost-vs-information curve. The DSGC bits-per-ATP ratio is unmeasured in the
literature, so the experiment closes a genuine open question. Tradeoff: this experiment does
not directly serve the project's first-question DSGC mission (DSI is not optimised); ranked
medium because it serves a broader scientific question rather than the project's specific
deliverable. Budget: 24-48 h Vast.ai EPYC at $0.30/h, total $8-15 — comparable to S-0097-02.

t0090 Phase G.3 committed the NaP-knockout driver as infrastructure_only because the
single-process wall-clock projection (~42 min/cell x 4 cluster representatives = ~3 hours)

t0059 has reliability = 1.0 across all FULL cells because each NetStim emits a single

t0059 fixes window_ms = 200 (midpoint of the published 100-300 ms SAC->DSGC IPSC envelope

t0057 swept GABA_BASE_NS in {0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0} nS and found a binary regime: gaba <=
1.0 nS produces uniform 0.667 Hz single-spike-per-trial (tonic too weak to override AMPA
spike) and gaba >= 1.5 nS produces 0 Hz full suppression. The sub-0.25 nS regime is
uncharacterised and may host a graded-suppression operating point where the tonic envelope
partially vetoes the AMPA spike on subset of trials, producing a probabilistic firing-rate
signal that could carry direction information. Run a finer sweep at GABA_BASE_NS in {0.05,

conductance-matched mean GABA mass: e.g., t0052 standard gabaMOD (66 nS) vs t0053 at 1.32 nS x
50 active = 66 nS, or matched at 100 nS. Use placement_seed0.json shared between tasks. Report
all six output classes (V(t), EPSP, IPSP, PSTH, tuning curve, active-fraction) plus
per-direction trial-for-trial diffs in soma V(t). Goal: isolate the spatial-vs-amplitude
mechanism contribution to DSI from the GABA-mass confound, settling the graded-vs-binary

<summary>🧪 <strong>Narrow-bar stimulus sweep (50, 100, 150 um) on minimal DSGC to
break the synchronous-firing regime</strong> (S-0053-04)</summary>

[t0053_minimal_dsgc_spatial_gaba](../../tasks/t0053_minimal_dsgc_spatial_gaba/)

Both t0052 and t0053 use a 200 um bar that crosses the entire dendritic field in one stimulus
epoch, so synapses fire near-synchronously and the cell sees a single dense
excitation+inhibition pulse per trial. This produces single-spike-per-trial behaviour (peak Hz
= 0.667 in AMPA-only) and binary on/off DSI dynamics in t0052, plus the full inhibition
pile-up that suppresses t0053. Re-run both minimal DSGCs (t0052 scalar gabaMOD and t0053
spatial centripetal at any non-suppressing g_GABA, e.g. 1.0 nS) under bar widths W in {50,
100, 150, 200} um at the same 1000 um/s velocity, so synapses fire sequentially over a longer
trial epoch. Report peak Hz, DSI, HWHM, reliability, and per-direction PSTH bin width. Goal:
test whether a narrower stimulus produces graded firing rates (multiple spikes per trial) and
a more biologically informative tuning curve under both inhibition mechanisms, decoupling DSI
dynamics from synchronous-volley artefacts. Recommended task types: experiment-run.

[t0053_minimal_dsgc_spatial_gaba](../../tasks/t0053_minimal_dsgc_spatial_gaba/)

t0052 scales all 100 I synapses by a graded gabaMOD(theta); t0053 binary-gates a subset at
full amplitude. A biologically motivated hybrid gates which I synapses fire (t0053's
per-synapse centripetal threshold) AND scales their amplitude by a global gabaMOD(theta)
factor (t0052's amplitude curve). This decomposition matches the SAC network's
centrifugal-release preference (spatial gating) layered on top of any global drive modulation.
Build a variant library `minimal_dsgc_hybrid_gaba` implementing both rules, sweep the gabaMOD
amplitude floor in {0.33, 0.5, 0.66, 1.0} at fixed centripetal threshold cos < 0, and report
DSI, peak Hz, HWHM, IPSP modulation, and active-fraction per floor. Goal: test whether
combining the two mechanisms produces a tuning curve closer to Park2014 / deRosenroll2026
bands than either alone. Recommended task types: build-model, experiment-run.

Alternative 'fix path B' to S-0050-01: instead of modulating gabaMOD per synapse, modify the
construction loop in RGCmodel.hoc:11839-11857 so SACinhib synapses are placed asymmetrically
across the dendritic field (more on the ND-side, fewer on the PD-side) while leaving BIPsyn
and SACexcsyn at the deposited 282-symmetric distribution. t0050 found total dendritic length
per side is essentially identical (2311 vs 2296 um) so the dendritic substrate supports an
asymmetric placement at construction. Test whether the somatic SEClamp PD/ND asymmetry reaches
paper Fig 3C targets without changing per-synapse gabaMOD. This decouples the deposited 'three

t0050 used three midline-x conventions (soma_x, zero, BIPsyn-locx-median) to classify synapses

dendritic branch identity: walk the section tree from soma, label each first-order branch as
proximal-PD or proximal-ND based on its dendritic-field axis, then label deeper segments as
distal. This finer partition would reveal whether the 282-synapse population has
within-PD-branch or within-ND-branch density gradients invisible to a single x-midline split,
and would provide the substrate-level data needed to design any future per-branch synaptic

The t0029 sweep failed as a mechanism discriminator because pref/null DSI is pinned at 1.000
at every multiplier from 0.5x to 2.0x (null firing = 0 Hz on every trial, reliability =
1.000). Dan2018's passive-TR derivation and Schachter2010's compartmental DSGC both assume
stochastic Poisson drive with a rate-code noise floor; removing noise collapses the

dendrite (independent seed, no direction bias) to the t0022 scheduler and rerun the full

The t0022 scheduler uses GABA_CONDUCTANCE_NULL_NS = 12 nS applied 10 ms before AMPA on
null-direction trials - about 4x the preferred value (3 nS) and 2x Schachter2010's measured

exactly 0 Hz, pinning the pref/null DSI denominator and the ratio at 1.000 before cable
mechanics have any effect. Sweep GABA_CONDUCTANCE_NULL_NS across {3, 6, 9, 12} nS at a fixed

<summary>🔧 <strong>Calibrate active Nav / Kv / Ih densities to match Poleg-Polsky
2016 spike shape and distal Ih sag</strong> (S-0009-03)</summary>

[t0009_calibrate_dendritic_diameters](../../tasks/t0009_calibrate_dendritic_diameters/)

Geometry alone does not recover the Schachter Rin targets; the residual gap needs active and
passive membrane parameters. On dsgc-baseline-morphology-calibrated, install Fohlmeister-like
Nav, delayed-rectifier Kv, and Ih channels and fit their densities (somatic vs dendritic) so
that (1) the somatic action-potential shape (halfwidth, peak, afterhyperpolarisation) matches
Poleg-Polsky 2016 Figure 2, and (2) the voltage-sag response to hyperpolarising current at
distal tips matches the Ih-driven sag amplitude reported in Schachter 2010. This is distinct
from S-0002-01 (DSI-maximising g_Na/g_K grid) and S-0002-02 (passive-vs-active DSI ablation):
it tunes channel densities against single-cell electrophysiological waveforms, not tuning
curves. Output: a library asset exposing the fitted mechanism list for reuse in the DSI
experiments. Recommended task types: experiment-run, feature-engineering.

Our three-bin heuristic collapses 170 Poleg-Polsky mid-role sections into one 1.653 um radius
(section F1 of creative_thinking.md). A lossless alternative is to Procrustes-align the CNG
xyz points with the Poleg-Polsky RGCmodel.hoc pt3dadd points, then for each CNG compartment
copy the diameter of the nearest registered source section. Preserves all 350 source diameters
and eliminates both the tie-break-induced primary bin boundary (section F3) and the
bin-collapse interior variability. Deliverable: a sibling dataset asset
dsgc-baseline-morphology-registered with a registration-quality report (residual xyz distance

The calibrated SWC uses only SWC type codes 1 (soma) and 3 (dendrite); downstream NEURON tasks
that set section-specific conductance densities (e.g., Na 150/150/30 mS/cm^2, K 70/70/35) must
re-derive Strahler order every time. Produce a sibling dataset asset
dsgc-baseline-morphology-calibrated-typed that re-types each row to 1 (soma), 5 (primary), 3
(mid), or 6 (terminal) using the calibration's bin labels. Topology, xyz, and parent_id are
preserved; only type_code changes. Add a conversion script and a smoke test that confirms
NEURON's Import3d loader accepts the extended type codes. Cuts duplicated Strahler

t0008 (port ModelDB 189347) is the first downstream consumer that will produce a real
simulated 12-angle tuning curve. Wire tuning_curve_loss.score into t0008's verification step
so the Poleg-Polsky reproduction's simulated curve is scored against the t0004 target and the

under the four registered keys (direction_selectivity_index, tuning_curve_hwhm_deg,
tuning_curve_reliability, tuning_curve_rmse). Deliverable: a short task that runs t0008's
simulated curve through score(), records ScoreReport.loss_scalar and passes_envelope, and
produces a side-by-side overlay plot (simulated vs target). This is the first end-to-end

The provenance decision in this task (source_paper_id = 10.1016_j.cub.2018.03.001) is grounded
in methodological consistency plus the NeuroMorpho.org curated attribution, not in an
exact-quote match: Morrie & Feller 2018 CB does not literally print 141009, Pair1DSGC,
biocytin, or Neurolucida in its Methods, and the paper publishes only SAC (not DSGC)
reconstructions. A downstream task should email the Feller lab (Murphy-Baum at
murphy-baum@berkeley.edu or Morrie at rmorrie@berkeley.edu) asking which specific paired
recording in the paper's Figure 2 cohort (n = 12 Control + 9 Sema6A-/- null + 6 Sema6A-/-
preferred) produced the 141009_Pair1DSGC reconstruction, and whether the companion SAC
reconstruction is deposited at NeuroMorpho. A one-sentence email-reply quote converts the
current 'methodologically consistent' attribution into a citeable exact-quote provenance, and
directly informs S-0013-03. Recommended task types: answer-question.

Under the native gabaMOD-swap protocol, DSI (0.7838) sits inside the [0.70, 0.85] envelope but
PD peak (14.85 Hz) is 25.15 Hz below the 40 Hz floor. Protocol is now ruled out, so the
shortfall must live on the excitation side. Run a factorial sweep over (a) BIP synapse count
{88, 177, 354}, (b) excMOD on AMPA+NMDA in {0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0}, (c) stimulus drive

Every downstream compartmental-modelling task in this project will need to load the

SWC compartment id, soma reference, and per-section parent links. NEURON's built-in Import3d
handling of CNG SWCs is fragile (soma-3point convention, branch-point splitting, axon stubs)
