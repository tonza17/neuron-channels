El-Quessny and Feller test whether the global shape of a DSGC’s dendritic arbor determines how
its excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are spatially organized. They exploit a natural
biological contrast: Hb9::GFP vDSGCs have strongly asymmetric dendrites oriented toward the
preferred direction, while Trhr::GFP nDSGCs have symmetric dendrites but similar
direction-selective spike output. The motivation is to dissociate two classical mechanisms of
retinal direction selectivity, tuned inhibition and spatially offset inhibition, and to ask
which of them tracks dendritic morphology.

Methodologically, the authors combine two-photon targeted whole-cell voltage clamp of EPSCs
(V_hold = -70 mV) and IPSCs (V_hold = 0 mV) with per-cell morphological reconstruction in
flat-mount mouse retina. Cells are probed with both drifting bars (eight directions, 250 um/s)
and a 10 x 10 stationary flash grid over a 500 x 500 um soma-centered field (30 x 30 um
squares), which allows independent measurement of directional tuning and 2D receptive-field
geometry. Additional experiments block nAChRs with 100 uM hexamethonium to separate
cholinergic from glutamatergic excitation, and a set of vector-based COM analyses quantifies
dendritic asymmetry, E-to-I spatial offset, per-pixel E vs I correlation, and the ratio of
synaptic-field to dendritic-field area.

The headline findings are a clean dissociation. Asymmetric vDSGCs show significantly sharper
directional tuning of inhibition than symmetric nDSGCs (IPSC DSI **0.48** vs **0.34** ON;
**0.56** vs **0.31** OFF), driven by weaker preferred-side inhibition. However, E-to-I spatial
offsets are small (**<50 um**) and comparable between subtypes, E and I amplitudes are locally
correlated (R^2 ~ 0.51-0.65 per pixel), and both receptive fields exceed the dendritic field
by a factor of **~1.6-3.3** because of cholinergic (SAC) input. Pharmacological block of
nAChRs shrinks the excitatory receptive field toward the dendritic field and reveals that
nDSGC glutamatergic fields point toward the null direction, whereas vDSGC glutamatergic fields
remain biased toward the preferred direction.

For this project, which aims to match single-DSGC angle-to-AP-frequency curves in a
compartmental model, the paper is foundational. It tells us (i) dendritic asymmetry matters
for tuned inhibition but not for spatial E/I organization, so a compartmental model that
ignores global morphology can still reproduce E/I spatial structure if it gets SAC-mediated
wiring right; (ii) synapse distributions should cover **1.6-3.3x** the dendritic footprint
with a co-varying local E/I amplitude ratio; (iii) the E-to-I spatial offset along the
preferred axis is **<50 um** and inhibition is locally correlated with excitation in strength;
and (iv) reproducing the gap between stationary-map and drifting-bar offsets requires
stimulus-dependent recruitment of lateral inhibition. These quantitative constraints directly
feed into the AMPA/GABA placement, synaptic density maps, and stimulus protocols used to tune
the project’s DSGC compartmental model.

This eLife paper asks a specific question about retinal direction selectivity: at what spatial
scale is the direction-selective computation actually performed inside the dendrites of an
ON-OFF DSGC? The question is motivated by decades of theoretical work (Koch, Poggio & Torre
1982; Schachter et al. 2010) proposing dendritic subunits on a 50–100 µm scale, by anatomical
evidence that starburst amacrine cells wrap varicosities around DSGC dendrites with
direction-dependent orientation (Briggman et al. 2011), and by earlier patch-clamp results
(Sivyer & Williams 2013) suggesting subthreshold local tuning. The authors set out to measure
that spatial scale directly in an intact mouse retina.

Their methodology combines two-photon Ca²⁺ imaging of small (3–4 µm) dendritic ROIs in
OGB-1-loaded DSGCs with voltage-gated Na⁺ channel blockade (intracellular QX-314 or bath TTX),
pharmacological dissection of NMDA receptors (D-AP5), genetic disruption of GABA release from
starburst amacrine cells (vGAT-KO), mechanical ablation of individual SACs via sharp-electrode
lesions, and a multi-compartmental NEURON model of a reconstructed DSGC with 177 E/I synaptic
pairs and stochastic release. The combination of imaging, targeted circuit perturbation, and
biophysical simulation is the paper's methodological core.

The headline findings are that DS information exists and is independently generated inside
5–10 µm dendritic segments — an order of magnitude smaller than classic cable-theory
estimates; that noise correlations between dendritic ROIs fall off with a 5.3 µm space
constant; that dendritic Ca²⁺ tuning matches somatic spiking tuning and is sharper than
subthreshold somatic voltage; that NMDA receptors scale responses multiplicatively without
altering PD or DSI; that ablating just 3–7 null-side SACs selectively disrupts DS at
interspersed dendritic hot spots leaving other segments intact; and that a soft dendritic
voltage threshold in the CaV activation range (−55 to −48 mV) is sufficient in the model to
convert homogeneously-tuned inputs into strongly-tuned, locally-independent compartments.

For this project the paper is central. It pins down the empirical target that an ON-OFF DSGC
compartmental model must reproduce: sharp somatic directional tuning that emerges from many
small, locally-tuned dendritic segments whose independence is enforced by dendritic threshold
nonlinearities and by spatially-precise GABAergic inhibition. It also supplies an explicit set
of channel conductances, a morphology reference (Poleg-Polsky & Diamond 2016), a ratio of 1:1
excitatory-to-inhibitory synapse count (177 each), and a concrete prediction — active
dendritic Na⁺/K⁺ channels are expected to sharpen tuning — that we will test directly as part
of our active-vs-passive dendrite experiment. The measured DSI distribution, angular SD of
~32°, and 5–10 µm compartment scale give us quantitative benchmarks to score candidate model
configurations against.

<summary>📖 Retinal direction selectivity in the absence of asymmetric starburst
amacrine cell responses — Hanson et al., 2019</summary>

Hanson et al. revisit one of the most entrenched assumptions in retinal neuroscience: that
direction selectivity in direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) is inherited from
the directionally tuned GABA release of starburst amacrine cells. They ask whether DSGCs can
still compute direction when starburst output itself is no longer directional, a question made
answerable for the first time by combining the Gabra2 conditional KO (which removes mutual SAC
inhibition) with optogenetic stimulation of SACs while bipolar-cell drive is pharmacologically
silenced.

Methodologically, the study integrates four approaches: cell-specific genetics to control SAC
inhibition, ChR2 optogenetics to control excitation of SACs in isolation, whole-cell and loose
cell-attached patch-clamp recordings to read out EPSCs, IPSCs, and spiking in the same DSGCs,
and a multicompartmental NEURON model (built on the Poleg-Polsky and Diamond 2016 DSGC
morphology) to test the computational sufficiency of the proposed mechanisms. Pharmacology
(hexamethonium, SR-95531, DL-AP4, UBP310, CNQX, D-AP5) isolates cholinergic, GABAergic, and
glutamatergic components. Modelling synapses and somatic Na/K/delayed-rectifier conductances
are set to densities matched to prior literature, and release probabilities are parameterised
sigmoidally with direction.

The central findings are that (i) starburst IPSC direction selectivity can be essentially
abolished (DSI about 0.07) while DSGC spiking remains robustly directional; (ii) the residual
DS is explained by a directionally tuned excitation-inhibition temporal offset of up to 50 ms
in the preferred direction, which corresponds to a relatively fixed 25-30 microm spatial
offset across velocities; (iii) this offset is cholinergic in origin, since hexamethonium
delays preferred-direction EPSCs by about 25 ms and collapses the offset; and (iv) the two DS
mechanisms (amplitude and timing) dominate different phases of the response: offsets sharpen
the early phase, amplitude differences broaden and stabilise the peak phase. The NEURON model
reproduces all of these features under both full and reduced wiring.

For this project, Hanson et al. 2019 is directly relevant on three fronts. First, it
constrains the target tuning curve: a single trial-averaged angle-to-AP-frequency curve is
unlikely to capture the dual-mechanism structure, so the target should ideally include
early-versus-peak temporal structure. Second, it provides a specific, reconstructed, publicly
available NEURON model (`geoffder/Spatial-Offset-DSGC-NEURON-Model`) with the exact
conductance recipe, passive properties, and distributed AMPA/ACh/GABA synapses needed as a
baseline for the morphology/conductance/input parametric variation planned here. Third, it
establishes that any realistic DSGC model in this project must treat excitation as two
distinct populations (bipolar AMPA and starburst ACh) with different spatial offsets, because
their differential timing is itself a DS mechanism that must be represented if the optimiser
is to fit mouse DSGC behaviour rather than a generic ON-OFF ganglion cell.

Koren, Grove, and Wei address a gap in the mechanistic understanding of retinal direction
selectivity: how the starburst amacrine cell (SAC) maintains the required balance between
electrotonic isolation and cross-compartmental signal integration in its dendrites, and how
that balance is regulated and coupled to direction-selective ganglion cell (DSGC) output.
Earlier work established that SAC dendritic sectors are semi-independent computational units
with centrifugal preference, but the mechanisms controlling the "semi" part of that isolation
were unknown.

Methodologically the paper combines two-photon GCaMP6 imaging of distal SAC varicosities,
whole-cell patch-clamp of SACs and DSGCs, subregion visual stimulation to dissociate local
from global dendritic activation, a selective pharmacology (LY341495 antagonist and LY354740
agonist) for mGluR2, and mGluR2 knockout mice as an off-target control. Voltage-gated calcium
channel subtypes are identified with omega-conotoxin GVIA (N-type) and omega-agatoxin IVA
(P/Q-type).

The central findings are that (i) the strong centrifugal response of distal SAC varicosities
during full-field motion is partly produced by trans-somatic signal integration from the
opposite side of the dendritic tree; (ii) mGluR2 signaling inhibits N- and P/Q-type VGCCs on
SACs to enforce sufficient electrotonic isolation during centripetal motion; (iii) blocking
mGluR2 selectively enhances preferred-direction IPSCs onto DSGCs (delay **289 ms at 440
um/s**, **147 ms at 1100 um/s**); and (iv) this aberrant inhibition reduces DSGC spiking
specifically at high motion speeds, contributing to the broad speed tuning of the
direction-selective circuit.

For this project's goal of a compartmental DSGC model that matches a target
angle-to-AP-frequency curve, the paper has two concrete implications. First, the IPSC input
model on the DSGC must reflect speed-dependent latency and amplitude arising from SAC
trans-somatic propagation rather than a speed-invariant null-direction inhibition. Second, the
saturation of centrifugal SAC calcium signals and null-direction DSGC IPSCs, even under strong
pharmacological perturbation, suggests that the target tuning curve can be reproduced with a
degenerate set of Na/K conductance combinations (RQ1 "ridge" hypothesis), because upstream
inhibition is the first-order constraint on firing at preferred direction and any well-chosen
conductance combination that preserves somatic excitability will suffice. Active dendritic
conductances in the DSGC (RQ4) can be evaluated against this framework, but the primary
directional signal arrives pre-shaped by SAC compartmental computation, not generated locally
in the DSGC dendrites.

Sethuramanujam et al. (2016) investigate the computational function of co-transmission of ACh
and GABA from SACs onto DSGCs, asking whether the excitatory/inhibitory transmitter mixture at
the same synapse has functional consequences beyond what single-transmitter models predict.
The study is conducted in rabbit retina across natural, low-contrast, and high-contrast visual
stimulation.

The authors combine whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from DSGCs with pharmacological
isolation of GABA, ACh, and glutamate receptor currents, a linear regression decomposition of
multi-component synaptic inputs, and optogenetic ChR2 activation of SACs while bipolar cell
input is silenced. These tools measure each transmitter contribution independently across
direction and contrast.

The central result is that ACh is the obligatory excitatory initiator at low contrast and
under natural stimuli, while glutamate through NMDA receptors acts as a dependent amplifier
via a nonlinear coincidence detection gate. Optogenetic isolation of the SAC network confirms
that SACs alone encode direction without upstream bipolar cell asymmetry. Both GABA and ACh
from SACs are direction-tuned, and their kinetic differences -- transient ACh vs. sustained
GABA -- contribute to the E/I asymmetry underlying direction selectivity.

For this project, the paper directly constrains the synaptic input parameterisation of a
compartmental DSGC model: cholinergic conductances must be direction-asymmetric and fast,
GABAergic conductances sustained and direction-asymmetric, and NMDA conductances
voltage-dependent with a contrast-dependent activation threshold. These constraints govern the
choice of AMPA, NMDA, and GABA-A conductance waveforms, their spatial distributions across the
dendritic arbor, and their directional weight asymmetries in the compartmental simulation.

Ganglion Cells Lack Direction Tuning — Park et al., 2014</summary>

Park et al. (2014) investigate the synaptic basis of direction selectivity in mouse On-Off
DSGCs, asking whether acetylcholine and glutamate inputs are genuinely directionally tuned
alongside the well-established null-direction GABA from starburst amacrine cells. The study is
motivated by a decade of contradictory voltage-clamp data that appeared to show
preferred-direction-tuned excitatory conductances, implying DS presynaptic release from
bipolar cells and SAC cholinergic terminals.

The authors combine whole-cell patch-clamp with simultaneous two-photon imaging of iGluSnFR
conditionally expressed on DSGC dendrites via CART-Cre mice, applying pharmacological
manipulations (hexamethonium for nicotinic block, gabazine for GABA-A block). Recording the
optical glutamate signal and electrical conductance in the same cell at the same time allows
direct dissociation of presynaptic release directionality from voltage-clamp measurement
artefacts.

The central result is unambiguous: glutamate release lacks directional tuning (iGluSnFR P - N
= +0.073 +/- 0.04, p = 0.95) even while simultaneously recorded excitatory current appears
tuned (+0.35 +/- 0.07 nS, p = 0.00015). Blocking GABA-A receptors with gabazine abolishes
apparent excitatory DS in both modalities, confirming the artefact arises from imperfect space
clamp during strong null-direction inhibition (2.43 +/- 0.31 nS). The DS index of recorded
cells is 0.65 +/- 0.05, establishing a quantitative target for model optimisation.

For this project's compartmental simulation, these results provide three hard constraints: (1)
excitatory inputs (glutamate and acetylcholine) must be modelled as omnidirectional; (2) null-
direction GABA inhibition is the primary DS-generating mechanism with a P - N magnitude of
approximately 2.4 nS; and (3) the target DS index for optimisation is 0.65-0.73 under in vitro
patch-clamp conditions. The space-clamp artefact warns against using apparent excitatory
tuning in experimental voltage-clamp traces to calibrate any model excitatory tuning
parameter.

Hoshi et al. (2011) demonstrate that the rabbit ON DS ganglion cell population, treated as a
single type for decades, actually comprises two distinct subtypes separable on six independent
criteria: tracer-coupling pattern, IPL stratification depth, dendritic branching complexity,
response latency, temporal transience, and cholinergic pharmacology. The study uses targeted
acridine-orange-guided recording and intracellular Neurobiotin/Lucifer Yellow injection in
isolated rabbit retinas, characterising 45-52 cells of each subtype -- the largest systematic
ON DS morphology-physiology dataset at the time of publication.

The uncoupled (sustained) subtype ramifies within the ON cholinergic band (~77% IPL depth),
cofasciculates with starburst amacrine dendrites, fires with long latency (381 ms peak) and
sustained character, is never tracer-coupled, and responds strongly to nicotine -- consistent
with the starburst-GABA direction-selectivity model. The coupled (transient) subtype
stratifies distal to the ChAT band (~57% IPL depth), does not cofasciculate with starburst
processes, fires with short latency (71 ms) and transient character, is gap-junction coupled
to 60-190 GABA-positive amacrine cells, and shows minimal nicotine sensitivity -- implying a
non-starburst directional mechanism.

Key quantitative findings: retroflexive terminal processes 14.7 vs. 2.4 (t(94) = 14.52, p <
0.001), dendritic self-crossings 16.5 vs. 4.6 (t(94) = 11.71, p < 0.001), stratification 57%
vs. 77% IPL depth (~3 um separation, confirmed 100% in direct crossings), and response latency
70.7 vs. 381.0 ms (p < 0.01). The two morphological measures together produce complete
population separation across 96 cells. Despite these mechanistic differences, both subtypes
produce equivalent directional output: three cardinal preferred axes, ~100 um/s preferred
velocity, and DSI ~0.66-0.67.

For the current project modelling a single ON DSGC compartmentally and optimising against a
target angle-to-AP-frequency tuning curve, this paper provides essential morphological
constraints. The uncoupled (sustained) subtype -- with high dendritic density, stratification
within the starburst band, and starburst-GABA input geometry -- is the appropriate target cell
type. Key validation benchmarks: DSI ~0.66, preferred velocity ~100 um/s, peak response
latency ~381 ms, stratification at ~77% IPL depth, eccentricity-area slope 0.0605 mm2/mm.
These constrain the morphology, wave- stimulus parameters, and response targets for
compartmental simulation.

Fohlmeister, Cohen, and Newman ask how ion channels are distributed across the dendrites,
soma, initial segment, and axon of rat and cat retinal ganglion cells, and how that
distribution must be scaled with temperature to reproduce whole-cell action-potential trains
across 7-37 C. The question matters because single-compartment or under-constrained
multicompartment models of RGCs have historically suffered from parameter degeneracy: many
G-bar maps can fit a recording at one temperature, and the community lacked a principled,
temperature-transferable channel set.

Methodologically, the authors record repetitive spiking in anatomically reconstructed rat Type
I and Type II and cat alpha and beta RGCs at multiple temperatures, then fit phase plots
(dV/dt versus V) of each cell with NEURON multicompartment simulations of the
Fohlmeister-Miller Five-channel model (Na, K(DR), Ca, K(A), K(Ca)). The crucial design choice
is to demand that a single G-bar map fit every temperature simultaneously, so temperature
becomes an identifiability lever, and to separate gating-kinetic Q10s from ion-permeability
Q10s in a GHK-style current equation.

They find that the voltage dependence of rate constants is constant within 7-23 C and within
30-37 C with a sharp transition at 23-30 C; that gating Q10s are ~1.9-1.95 and permeability
Q10s are ~1.5-1.65 above 23 C but climb toward ~8 below 10 C; and that Na channels become
non-Arrhenius below 8 C, with spike failure below 7 C. Peak Na conductance is concentrated on
a thin axonal segment 50-130 um distal to the soma (up to 448 mS/cm^2 in cat alpha), and the
temperature dependence of the IS-SD phase-plot break confirms this localization. A single
cell-type-specific channel map fits all temperatures.

For this project, which is building DSGC compartmental models, this paper is foundational: it
provides a fully calibrated, temperature-scaled Five-channel parameter set for retinal
ganglion cells in rat and cat, including the Na hotspot location, the dendritic Na+K(A) safety
factor, and the two-plateau temperature-scaling scheme. The G-bar tables and Q10 values should
be adopted as the default channel-density prior for DSGC models, modified only where
DSGC-specific evidence demands it, and the phase-plot fitting methodology should be used to
calibrate DSGC compartmental models against future whole-cell recordings.

The paper asks why two morphologically distinct direction-selective ganglion cells in the
rabbit retina, the bistratified ON-OFF DSGC and the monostratified ON DSGC, have different
velocity tuning despite sharing the same directional computation. Using a combined
extracellular-spiking and whole-cell voltage-clamp protocol in the isolated rabbit retina, the
authors record spiking direction-velocity tuning and then isolate the light-evoked excitatory
and inhibitory synaptic conductances under voltage clamp at the chloride and cation reversal
potentials respectively.

Methodologically, the work is an application of the now-standard two-conductance decomposition
to a velocity-tuning question: the same drifting-grating and local-flicker stimuli are
presented under current- and voltage-clamp, and conductances are computed from
holding-potential-dependent currents while sodium channels are blocked with intracellular
QX-314. Direction tuning is quantified with a DSI and von Mises kappa; temporal tuning is
quantified by measuring the peak excitatory and inhibitory conductances as a function of
temporal frequency. Cell types are confirmed post hoc by dye-fill morphology to ensure that
reported differences are not confounded by misclassification.

The central finding is that the direction-selective mechanism itself is identical in the two
cell types (preferred-side excitation, null-side inhibition, with GI,N/GI,P around 3.4 and
GE,P/GE,N around 1.6) but that the velocity bandwidth differs because the ON DSGC receives a
transient inhibitory conductance that precedes a slower sustained excitatory conductance, and
the ratio of inhibition to excitation grows with temporal frequency. In ON-OFF DSGCs, by
contrast, both conductances are approximately flat from 0.5 to 8 Hz, producing the broad
velocity response for which these cells are known.

For this project, the paper is load-bearing because it converts the qualitative statement that
ON DSGCs prefer slow motion into a quantitative recipe for the inputs of a compartmental
model: spatially asymmetric preferred/null conductance ratios, temporally mismatched rise and
decay kinetics, and a specific lead-lag offset between inhibition and excitation. These
constraints directly inform both the EPSP/IPSP amplitude-and-kinetics sweep and the
wave-stimulus protocol described in the project scope, and supply a matched ON vs ON-OFF
comparison framework against which the model velocity-tuning output can be validated.

Chen et al. (2009) investigate the electrophysiology of ON-OFF direction-selective retinal
ganglion cells across postnatal development in the C57BL/6N mouse, asking when directional
computation first appears and whether visual experience shapes its development. Using
whole-cell patch clamp in the isolated retina, they record from DSGCs at P11, P13, P18, and
adulthood, and test mice reared in complete darkness from P0-P11 and P0-P30.

The approach combines loose-patch identification (DSI > 0.3 threshold), whole-cell
voltage-clamp for EPSC kinetics at -65 mV and 0 mV, and current-clamp for excitability and
directional tuning curves (12 directions, 30-degree spacing, bar 100 um x 500 um at
approximately 750 um/s). Cells were morphologically confirmed as bistratified ON-OFF DSGCs by
intracellular dye fills.

The central result is a developmental dissociation: spike counts are roughly half adult values
at P11 (ON: **21.2 +/- 4.4** vs adult **42.9 +/- 5.1 spikes**; peak rate **95.9** vs **166.4
Hz**), EPSC kinetics are significantly slower (*p* < 0.0001), and synaptic reliability is
markedly reduced -- yet DSI and tuning-curve half-width are adult-equivalent at all ages (*p*
> 0.05). Dark rearing does not alter directional tuning, confirming the circuit is fully
light-independent.

For this project, Chen et al. (2009) supply the primary empirical validation target. The
quantitative tuning metrics (DSI, half-width) from the standardised 12-direction protocol
define the target angle-to-AP-frequency relationship the compartmental model must reproduce.
The specific stimulus parameters should be replicated verbatim in the model wave protocol. The
robustness of directional tuning to excitability variations motivates sensitivity analyses in
which somatic Na/K conductances are varied widely without expecting the tuning curve to
collapse.

Oesch, Euler, and Taylor address a central unresolved question in retinal direction
selectivity: why does a ganglion cell whose somatic subthreshold EPSPs are only weakly
directional produce spike output that is sharply tuned to the preferred direction of motion?
By combining whole-cell current-clamp recordings from ON-OFF DSGCs in flat-mounted rabbit
retina with focal and dendritic TTX application, intracellular QX-314, controlled somatic
hyperpolarization, and two-photon Ca2+ imaging of dendritic arbors, they dissect the spatial
origin of the spikes that drive DSGC output during visual stimulation.

The headline finding is a bimodal spike amplitude distribution - large ~55 mV somatic action
potentials and small ~7 mV dendritic spikelets - that can be separated by any of three
independent manipulations (somatic TTX, QX-314, somatic hyperpolarization). The dendritic
spikelets inherit the full directional tuning of the somatic output (DSI ~0.6-0.7),
superimpose at sub-somatic-refractory intervals, and are selectively suppressed by puffing TTX
onto the dendrites (reducing light-evoked spikes by ~42% while barely affecting
depolarization-evoked somatic spikes). Calcium imaging confirms that the dendrites host
functional TTX-sensitive Na+ channels active during light-driven responses.

Mechanistically, the authors argue that direction selectivity is computed by dendritic spike
failure: locally offset GABAergic inhibition from starburst amacrine cells, positioned between
bipolar-cell excitation and the soma along the null-direction pathway, shunts dendritic spikes
before they can reach the soma. In the preferred direction the inhibition is distal to the
excitation, so dendritic spikes propagate successfully. This model naturally explains the
nondirectional zone on the preferred side of the receptive field and the preferred-side
receptive field offset.

For a DSGC compartmental modeling project, this paper is foundational. It supplies the
quantitative targets (somatic PSP amplitudes of ~12 mV across all directions, somatic
threshold near -49 mV, dendritic spikelet amplitude ~7 mV, spike DSI ~0.7 versus PSP DSI ~0.1)
that any biophysical simulation must reproduce, and it specifies the qualitative requirements:
active dendrites with distributed Na+ channels, multiple independent initiation zones,
on-the-path starburst inhibition, and a near-unity dendritic-to-somatic spike coupling. Any
model that relies on passive dendrites and a single somatic threshold cannot reach the
observed tuning sharpness and should be rejected on quantitative grounds.

Taylor and Vaney (2002) ask whether direction selectivity in rabbit On-Off DSGCs arises from
directional upstream circuitry (presynaptic), from local postsynaptic E/I interactions in the
dendrites, or from a combination of both. The motivation is to resolve a contradiction between
their own 2000 study (postsynaptic conclusion) and a contemporaneous turtle study (presynaptic
conclusion), using a more complete conductance analysis in rabbit retina.

The approach is whole-cell voltage clamp in whole-mount retina with cesium-gluconate and
QX-314 to block intrinsic voltage-gated currents, enabling linear I-V relationships from which
synaptic conductance and reversal potential are extracted every 10 ms across 9 holding
potentials. Excita- tory and inhibitory conductances are isolated by two-component
decomposition at assigned reversal potentials (Ve ~0 mV, Vi ~-65 mV). Spatial offsets of
inhibition are computed from inter- direction timing differences of conductance peaks,
assuming centred receptive fields.

Three mechanisms are found to coexist: preferred-direction excitation (**1.66x** on, **1.36x**
off), null-direction inhibition (**3.31x** on, **1.40x** off), and a **160 um** postsynaptic
spatial offset of off-inhibition with no equivalent in the on-arbor. The on-arbor relies
chiefly on the two presynaptic asymmetries; the off-arbor additionally uses the postsynaptic
spatial offset. Total conductance is nearly balanced across directions (~118% null/preferred),
because directional excitation and inhibition partially cancel. Both subarbors achieve
identical directional tuning (D ~0.56) through distinct mechanisms, demonstrating
within-neuron functional heterogeneity.

For this project, Taylor and Vaney (2002) is the primary empirical anchor for synaptic input
parameters in the DSGC compartmental model. The null/preferred Gi ratios (**3.31x** on,
**1.40x** off) constrain the inhibitory conductance asymmetry that the model must reproduce.
The 160 um inhibitory spatial offset in the off-subarbor specifies the spatial profile of
inhibitory synapse placement. The push-pull E/I structure implies both excitatory and
inhibitory conductances must be directionally modulated. The large cell-to-cell variability
justifies treating E/I ratios as free parameters in the optimisation, bounded by the reported
means and standard deviations.
