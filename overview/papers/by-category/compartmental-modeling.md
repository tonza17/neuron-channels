Poleg-Polsky uses a machine-learning parameter search over a 352-segment biophysical model of
a mouse ON-OFF DSGC to enumerate mechanisms that can produce direction selectivity. The search
space includes bipolar-cell input geometry, synaptic kinetics, NMDA receptor placement and
strength, dendritic voltage-gated channel densities, and the presence or absence of
SAC-derived inhibition. Thousands of candidate configurations are simulated under standardised
moving-bar stimuli and scored on DSI.

The search reveals that many qualitatively different mechanisms can produce robust direction
selectivity. Dendrite-intrinsic primitives - velocity-dependent coincidence detection,
distance-graded passive delay lines, NMDA-mediated multiplicative gating - are each sufficient
on their own. Hybrid configurations that combine these primitives with SAC-derived inhibition
match experimental DSI most closely. Targeted ablations confirm each primitive is causally
responsible for DSI within its cluster.

The paper challenges the textbook view that starburst amacrine cells are the dominant
substrate of DSGC direction selectivity. Instead, it argues the DSGC dendrite itself is a
richer computational organ capable of producing DS via multiple biophysically plausible
strategies, and that the retinal circuit likely exploits several of them in parallel.

For t0010_hunt_missed_dsgc_models, this paper is a high-priority candidate. The companion code
(`PolegPolskyLab/DS-mechanisms`) provides a NEURON + Python 352-segment DSGC model exposing
exactly the parameters our project is interested in probing - bipolar-cell input structure,
kinetics, NMDA strength, and dendritic biophysics. The ML-discovered configurations give us a
library of distinct tuning-curve shapes to include in comparative analyses. The primary
porting risk is the absent LICENSE file; a licence clarification intervention or
fork-under-MIT may be required before the code can be redistributed.

This paper addresses how starburst amacrine cells shape direction selectivity in ON-OFF DSGCs
at the subcellular scale, focusing on the differential release of GABA and ACh. The authors
combine two-photon Ca2+ imaging of local DSGC dendritic subunits with a biophysically detailed
NEURON network model that explicitly represents the anatomical offset between SAC-GABA and
SAC-ACh synapses onto the DSGC.

Using acetylcholinesterase blockade, they perturb ACh dynamics while preserving the global
excitation/inhibition balance across the dendritic tree. Experimentally, this preserves
cell-wide firing but degrades direction selectivity at the local subunit level. The network
model reproduces the dissociation and attributes it to local uncoupling of E and I caused by
spatiotemporal perturbation of ACh relative to spatially offset GABA.

The central finding is that direction-selective computation in a DSGC is not a simple function
of whole-cell E/I balance, but depends on a *microstructured* alignment of GABA and ACh
release from SACs. Perturbing this alignment - even without disturbing the global ratio - is
sufficient to compromise the cell direction selectivity at the subunit scale. The authors call
this the "hidden" synaptic microarchitecture of the DS circuit.

For the current project (t0010_hunt_missed_dsgc_models), the paper is a top-priority
candidate: it publishes a new MIT-licensed NEURON + Python DSGC network model with
differential GABA/ACh wiring, directly addresses the project research question of how local
synaptic input patterns determine DSGC tuning, and extends the canonical Poleg-Polsky 2016
model already ported by t0008. The companion repository
(`geoffder/ds-circuit-ei-microarchitecture`, Zenodo 10.5281/zenodo.17666157) ships a driver
script, MOD files, and a HOC geometry that should be amenable to an automated port with a thin
12-direction tuning-curve wrapper. The main limitation for this summary is that the published
PDF could not be downloaded (Elsevier 403), so all quantitative values above that are not
cited from the abstract should be re-verified once a human reviewer retrieves the article
manually.

Werginz, Kiraly, and Zeck (2024) ask whether the spike generator of mouse alpha-RGCs is itself
tuned to each cell type downstream computational role, or whether sustained-vs-transient
firing phenotypes arise purely from upstream synaptic circuitry. They isolate the spike
generator pharmacologically, record from 73 wild-type and 48 rd10-degenerate alpha-RGCs across
three subtypes (alpha-ON sustained, alpha-OFF sustained, alpha-OFF transient), and quantify
nine spike-shape and firing-pattern features per cell.

The methodology combines whole-cell current-clamp recordings (with all major synaptic
transmission blocked) and a five-tier compartmental NEURON model. The model partitions an
alpha-RGC into dendrites, soma, soma-AIS, AIS, and axon, each with its own densities of Nav,
Kv, Cav, K(Ca), Ih, and leak - all calibrated to mouse rather than the historical rat/cat
parameter sets. AIS densities are particularly high (1300 mS/cm^2 Nav, 800 mS/cm^2 Kv),
establishing the AIS as the dominant spike-generation locus. UMAP + GMM clustering of the
spike-feature vectors achieves an adjusted Rand index of 0.8 against the morphological
cell-type labels.

The paper finds that the three alpha-RGC types differ substantially in intrinsic spike output:
alpha-OFF transient cells have the shortest spikes (**0.21 ms** vs **0.31 ms** for alpha-ON
sustained), the lowest sustained-to-peak ratio (**0.32** vs **0.57**), and the highest peak
firing rates (**346 Hz** vs **278 Hz**). The compartmental model reproduces these differences
via small modulations of AIS Nav density and somatic leak conductance. Crucially, the same
firing-type distinctions persist in rd10 photoreceptor-degenerated retina up to p227,
demonstrating that alpha-RGC intrinsic properties are circuit-independent once established.

For the t0078 multi-tier MOBO project, this paper is the most directly load-bearing source we
have seen for the 49-dimensional parameter-space tier bounds. The Werginz Table 1 densities
provide mouse-specific central tendencies for all six channels across all five compartments;
the soma-vs-AIS ratios (17.3x Nav, 16.7x Kv) and the dendritic Ih (1.30x somatic) define the
tier stratification structure that t0078 was designed around. The within-cell-type variance
also provides empirical sigma values for the prior, replacing the previously assumed values
lifted from Fohlmeister 2010. The model demonstration that +/- 20% modulation of AIS Nav and
somatic leak suffices to reproduce sustained-vs-transient differences provides a tight prior
for the most important search dimensions and justifies narrower bounds on K(Ca) and Cav,
freeing search budget for the high-leverage parameters.

Mueller, Draguhn, and Egorov publish a systematic review of persistent sodium current (INaP)
in CNS neurons in Pfluegers Archiv (Springer Nature, open access). The motivation is that INaP
is a clinically important regulator of excitability - implicated in epilepsy, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, neuropathic pain, hemiplegic migraine, and post-injury hyperexcitability -
but the literature is fragmented across heterogeneous voltage-clamp protocols, inconsistent
definitions of persistent versus slowly inactivating, and a sprawling catalogue of putative
blocker drugs whose specificities have never been compared head-to-head.

The review proceeds in two parts. The first part formalises four candidate mechanisms
(modified Hodgkin-Huxley window current; Markov gating with closed-state inactivation or modal
gating; subtype-specific generation by Nav1.1/1.2/1.3/1.6 plus beta1/beta4 modulation;
supra-molecular coupled gating) and four canonical voltage-clamp protocols (brief step,
entry-into-slow inactivation, slow steady-state inactivation, slow ramp). It explicitly maps
which protocol isolates which kinetic component, dissolving longstanding terminological
disagreements. The second part is a 22-drug catalogue (Table 1) tabulating IC50/EC50, holding
potential, preparation, protocol, and effects on INaP versus INaT for each substance.

The headline finding is that GS967 and riluzole are the only bona fide INaP blockers - they
act on the truly non-inactivating component across both brief-step and slow-ramp protocols at
clinically achievable concentrations and with limited off-target action. Phenytoin and
lacosamide are reclassified as selective enhancers of intermediate and slow inactivation
respectively, not INaP blockers proper. All other 18 surveyed substances are disqualified by
off-target Ca, K, GABA, or mGluR effects, by poor blood-brain-barrier penetration, or by
inadequate slow-inactivation data. The review concludes with a methodological recommendation:
combine brief steps, slow-inactivation steps, and slow ramps with TTX subtraction, and require
concordant effects of two drugs or a dynamic-clamp control before claiming an INaP role for
any physiological phenomenon.

For this project, the review most important message is a negative one: there is no
DSGC-specific INaP density measurement in the surveyed literature, so the cortical-pyramidal
Stuart 1999 / Astman 2021 priors used in t0086 / t0088 / t0091 remain the best cross-cell
baseline and the morphology-extended NSGA-II distal-NaP density bounds do not need to be
revised. The methodological caution that slow ramps underestimate INaP is a prior to keep on
file for any future patch-clamp validation step but does not affect the present in-silico
NEURON-based optimisation pipeline. The drug catalogue is a useful reference if the project
ever extends into dynamic-clamp INaP-cancellation experiments, where riluzole-equivalent block
at 10 uM is the canonical reference manipulation.

Wu et al. (2023) build a compartmental macaque ON starburst amacrine cell (SAC) model in
NeuronC based on a connectomic reconstruction (Kim et al. 2022) and use it to resolve a
two-decade debate about the origin of direction selectivity (DS) in SAC dendrites. They
compare two mechanisms: the "morphological" mechanism (electrotonic delay along thin medial
dendrites plus a sealed-cable effect at thick distal tips), and the "space-time" mechanism
(spatially segregated sustained midget and transient DB4/5 bipolar inputs). By constructing
matched sustained-only and sustained+transient models they cleanly partition the two
contributions.

Methodologically, the model is dense enough to be realistic but simple enough to be
interpretable: 400-700 compartments, biophysically parameterised bipolar cells, a 2D stimulus
grid of bar widths (50-500 um) x velocities (100-10,000 um/s), and 30 random replicates per
cell. Voltage-gated Na and Ca channels are deliberately omitted from the SAC in the main
analysis to isolate the subthreshold origin of DS. A separate morphology sweep varies distal
(0.2-1.2 um) and medial (0.1-0.35 um) dendritic diameters, and a mouse SAC model (Ding et al.
2016 morphology) is run alongside as a cross-species morphology manipulation.

The headline result is a clean phase diagram: the morphological mechanism dominates for small,
fast objects (peak DSI ~0.32 at bar width 50 um, velocity 2000 um/s) while the space-time
mechanism dominates for large, slow objects (DSI goes from ~0.16 sustained-only to ~0.22
sustained+transient at 500 um bars, 200 um/s). DSI is maximised when medial diameter sits at
0.2-0.25 um (matching the EM anatomy) and distal diameter >=0.8 um. Dendritic N/P/Q Ca
channels regeneratively amplify the subthreshold DS signal (voltage DSI 0.28 -> 0.46, [Ca] DSI
0.78 in a single run). The mouse model reproduces the same phase structure despite different
bipolar input densities and spatial distribution.

For our t0027 literature survey on computational models linking neuronal morphology to DS,
this paper is a strong positive example of the sweep-morphology-measure-DS paradigm we are
documenting. The morphology variable is SAC dendritic geometry (not DSGC), and the outcome is
DSI at the distal varicosity. It provides a concrete anchor for (a) the expected DSI range in
SAC-only compartmental models (~0.1-0.4 in voltage, up to ~0.8 in dendritic Ca), (b) the
velocity-tuning curve of the morphological mechanism (peak near 2000 um/s in macaque), and (c)
the quantitative impact of medial vs distal diameter on DSI. Limitations to note for our
survey: the model omits GABAergic, glycinergic, and cholinergic network interactions; DSGC
morphology is absent; only one tree topology is used (diameters are swept but branching
pattern and total dendritic length are not). These gaps will need to be filled by other papers
in the survey that sweep DSGC morphology or vary branching asymmetry.

Wienbar and Schwartz introduce the Bursty Suppressed-by-Contrast (bSbC) RGC of the mouse
retina and ask why it transmits a contrast-suppression signal while the OFF sustained Alpha
(OFFsA) RGC, which receives nearly identical synaptic input, transmits a high-rate
sustained-contrast signal. The paper's research question is therefore explicitly about the
contribution of cell-intrinsic spike generation machinery, rather than upstream circuitry, to
RGC feature selectivity.

The methodology combines voltage-clamp measurement of excitatory and inhibitory conductance
traces, current-clamp recordings of spike shape, confocal imaging of the AIS labelled with
ankyrin-G, sodium-channel pharmacology with the Nav1.6-selective blocker 49TTX, and a NEURON
7.7 compartmental model in which the AIS is split into a proximal Nav1.2 subsegment and a
distal Nav1.6 subsegment. The two cell types share the same dendritic and somatic architecture
in the model, and the only systematic differences are AIS length (22 +/- 1.7 um in OFFsA vs 16
+/- 1.5 um in bSbC) and Nav1.6 fraction (~40 percent in OFFsA vs ~0 percent in bSbC).

The headline finding is that the divergent contrast response functions of the two cells emerge
from the spike generator alone. The bSbC cell's short, Nav1.2-dominated AIS is driven into
depolarisation block by strong contrast inputs, silencing the cell, while OFFsA's longer
Nav1.6-rich AIS sustains high firing rates under the same drive. 49TTX selectively reduces
OFFsA spike amplitude with no effect on bSbC, confirming the Nav1.6 contribution. AIS length
differs significantly (p = 0.018) while diameter does not (p = 0.83), localising the
anatomical signature.

For task t0078 (and the broader project) the paper matters in three ways. First, it provides a
public, openly licensed NEURON model of a two-subsegment AIS with realistic Nav1.2/Nav1.6
parameterisation, length 16-22 um, and diameter ~1.3 um, archived at Zenodo DOI
10.5281/zenodo.6423531. This is the substrate that t0078 is going to port in place of the
paywalled Werginz 2020 model. Second, it establishes that AIS heterogeneity is an empirically
documented driver of RGC feature selectivity, not just a modelling convenience, which
strengthens the biological-plausibility case for tiered AHP plus tiered AIS in the DSGC v2
model. Third, it demonstrates depolarisation block as a meaningful coding mechanism, which
means t0078's firing-rate metrics need to remain well-defined when the AIS enters block under
strong drive.

This paper addresses a longstanding open question in retinal direction selectivity: whether
the connectomically-inspired "space-time wiring" model — in which proximal starburst amacrine
cell (SAC) dendrites receive tonic/sustained glutamate release from BC7 bipolar cells and
distal dendrites receive transient release from BC5 subtypes — is experimentally verifiable
and computationally sufficient to shape SAC dendritic direction selectivity. Prior imaging
surveys had reported uniform BC kinetics, casting doubt on the model, while prior connectomic
and voltage-clamp work had left the input-kinetic verification gap unclosed. Srivastava et al.
close this gap by combining SAC-targeted iGluSnFR imaging with compartmental modeling.

Methodologically, the authors injected Cre-dependent iGluSnFR into ChAT-Cre mouse retinas and
imaged glutamate signals at 5 µm ROI resolution along individual ON-SAC dendrites and across
population fields of view, varying stimulus spot size from 100 to 800 µm and applying a
GABA_A/GABA_C/AMPA blocker cocktail to isolate network contributions. They then deconvolved
the fluorescence with a fitted quantal iGluSnFR kernel to recover per-site vesicle release
rates, which they fed into a ball-and-stick NEURON SAC model whose synapse positions were
sampled from Ding et al. 2016 connectomic BC7/BC5 probability density functions (6 proximal +
12 distal per trial).

Empirically, they find a robust proximal-to-distal gradient in sustained/transient index (STi
≈ 0.33 proximal vs 0.16 distal on single dendrites, 0.34 vs 0.21 at population level), a 3×
higher steady-state release rate proximally (~3 vs ~1 vesicles/s), persistence of this
gradient under full inhibitory blockade, and — critically — in silico demonstrations that
swapping the proximal/distal kinetic arrangement reverses the SAC's preferred direction, that
homogenizing kinetics abolishes DS, and that DSi grows linearly with proximal-distal BC
separation distance. The effect is statistically significant up to 1 mm/s stimulus velocity
and strongest below 0.5 mm/s.

For the present project's morphology-shapes-DS literature survey, this paper is important for
three reasons. First, it is a clean example of **input-on-dendrite morphology** shaping DS:
the spatial arrangement of kinetically distinct synaptic inputs *along* the SAC dendrite,
rather than the dendritic branching structure per se, produces the DS signal — a mechanism
readily generalizable to DSGC models constrained by connectomic priors. Second, it provides a
validated pipeline (iGluSnFR → temporal deconvolution → release-rate-driven NEURON model)
reusable for DSGC studies. Third, it delineates the **scope limitation** of the
space-time-wiring mechanism (slow stimuli only), which must be respected when extrapolating to
DSGC DS where high-velocity DS is known to be robust. The paper is tagged "SAC, not DSGC" in
our survey: it operates one layer upstream of the canonical DSGC but contributes a mechanism
that any end-to-end morphology-DS model of the DSGC-afferent circuit must incorporate.

To, Honnuraiah, and Stuart address a direct extension of the Poleg-Polsky and Diamond 2011
analysis: how much additional voltage-clamp error is introduced by active dendritic
voltage-gated channels, which are present in every real neuron and absent from the
passive-dendrite 2011 simulations? Using detailed NEURON compartmental models with realistic
reconstructed morphologies and distributed voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels, they run the
standard multi-holding-potential E/I decomposition protocol and compare the recovered
conductance waveforms against ground truth.

The design systematically isolates the contribution of active channels by comparing matched
models with and without the voltage-gated conductances. Synaptic placement, timing, and
holding-potential range are varied to map which experimental conditions drive the largest
errors. The paper quantifies what prior work had identified as a qualitative caveat.

The results are unambiguous: active dendritic channels substantially worsen the decomposition
error beyond the passive case, and under some conditions produce physically impossible
negative inhibitory conductance estimates. There is no holding-potential choice that is
globally accurate; the experimenter is forced to trade Ge accuracy against Gi accuracy. The
recommended mitigation (blocking active channels with TTX and K+ blockers) has its own cost
because it removes the circuit dynamics being studied.

For this project, the implication is cumulative with the Poleg-Polsky result. Every published
DSGC voltage-clamp E/I trace we will use to calibrate our NEURON model has been distorted by
both passive cable attenuation and active dendritic processing. Our modelling pipeline must
model both: the simulated voltage-clamp block must include dendritic active channels, and we
must expect substantially larger calibration uncertainty on distal synaptic conductance
amplitudes than the Poleg-Polsky bounds alone would suggest.

Ezra-Tsur and colleagues attack a long-standing problem in retinal computation: determining
which of several competing mechanisms (input layout, input kinetics, intrinsic ion channels,
reciprocal inhibition) produces the centrifugal preference of SAC dendrites that, in turn,
drives direction selectivity in DSGCs. Because these mechanisms are experimentally difficult
to isolate, the authors build RSME - a NEURON-encapsulating framework that ties together
detailed morphology, biophysics, retinal connectivity rules, and visual stimuli - and use it
as a counterfactual engine.

The methodological core is a genetic-algorithm sweep over an 8-dimensional parameter space
that controls the spatial density of bipolar-to-SAC synapses and the per-synapse release
kinetics, holding the passive SAC morphology (1013-compartment NeuroMorpho NMO_139062) fixed.
By varying only the input-on-dendrite layout the authors show that spatiotemporally diverse
excitation - sustained proximal, transient distal - is sufficient to reproduce experimentally
measured CSI (~0.18) and RTI (~0.33); reversing the arrangement eliminates CF preference (0/N
cells), and fixing it gives 4/2125 barely-CF cells. In a subsequent 13-SAC network, reciprocal
inhibition modulates but does not generate CF preference, peaking at ~0.1 nS.

The DSGC results are the most load-bearing for this project morphology-focused survey:
embedding a reconstructed DSGC (NMO_05318, 1013 compartments, passive, -49 mV threshold, -52
mV baseline) in the SAC network and flipping between random and asymmetric null-side
SAC-to-DSGC wiring shows that asymmetric wiring alone produces positive DSI and PD activation,
even when the SAC network has no CF preference. SAC-SAC inhibition improves DSI modestly under
noiseless stimuli and strongly under noisy stimuli - reproducing the Chen et al. short-term
depression mechanism - while asymmetric wiring remains necessary throughout. These are
specific, quantitative necessity/sufficiency claims.

For this project on computational models linking neuronal morphology to direction-selectivity,
the paper is a clear inclusion: it uses compartmental models with explicit reconstructed
morphology, it varies the input-on-dendrite layout (and separately the SAC-SAC inhibition
strength) as the causal variable, and it measures DSGC outcome via DSI and related indices. It
should be cited as the canonical RSME reference, and the specific numerical anchors
(compartment counts, conductances, Exp2Syn parameters, 0.1 nS SAC-SAC, 0.5 nS SAC-DSGC,
spiking threshold -49 mV) should be reused as starting points or baselines in any follow-up
morphology-sweep tasks that embed a DSGC in a SAC network. A limitation is that SACs are
passive-only (no ion channels), so claims about the role of SAC intrinsic properties versus
input layout are by construction bounded - this is explicitly acknowledged in the Discussion,
and the authors note RSME can implement active channels in future studies.

Goethals et al. study the biophysical organization of the axon initial segment in mouse
retinal ganglion cells, addressing how a narrow (~1 um diameter) structure reliably transmits
the action potential to the much larger soma. The AIS must produce an axial current strong
enough to depolarize the soma by ~30 mV to reach somatic spike regeneration threshold, a
demanding requirement given the geometric impedance mismatch at the axosomatic junction. Prior
estimates of AIS Nav conductance density in RGCs came only from computational model fitting to
AP shape; this paper provides the first direct functional measurement via the axial current
itself.

The approach combines whole-cell voltage-clamp measurement of the axial current with post-hoc
ankyrin-G immunolabeling to measure AIS geometry in each recorded cell (P10-12 mouse retina, n
= 14-17 cells). Resistive coupling theory is applied to these paired measurements to estimate
AIS Nav conductance density. Additionally, the adaptation of the axial current with membrane
potential is characterized, revealing that temporal broadening by Kv1 channel inactivation
reduces effective charge attenuation from 12-fold (peak current) to only 3-fold (total charge)
over a 20 mV depolarization.

Key quantitative results: mean axial current **-6.7 +/- 1.8 nA**; minimum Nav conductance
density from cable theory **~1200 S/m2 (d = 1 um)** or **~2467 S/m2 (d = 0.8 um)**; best-fit
from resistive coupling theory **~5000-5500 S/m2 (50-55 mS/cm2)**; charge-capacitance slope
**31 mV** matching the spike-to-regeneration gap; **12-fold peak current** versus **3-fold
charge attenuation** over 20 mV depolarization. These converge with Guo et al. 2013 model
estimates (5000 S/m2) and Werginz 2020 Sci. Adv. values (~1300 mS/cm2).

For t0080, this paper provides an independent empirical lower bound on AIS Nav density in
mouse RGCs supporting the hard biological floor nav16_ais >= 0.25 S/cm2. The conservative
minimum (~10-12.6 mS/cm2) exceeds this floor by ~40-50x; the best-fit (~50-55 mS/cm2) by
~200x, confirming the floor is conservative. The paper establishes that AIS diameter is a
critical free parameter (0.7-1.2 um proximal range from measurements) and that the charge-
capacitance coupling principle should inform how AIS geometry bounds are set relative to soma
size in t0080 MOBO optimization.

Werginz, Raghuram, and Fried investigate how intrinsic biophysics downstream of the dendrites
shapes the spike output of OFF-alpha transient retinal ganglion cells. Their hypothesis is
that the AIS is specialised to match the synaptic input that each cell type receives. Using a
combined experimental and computational approach (patch-clamp current-clamp recordings, Nav1.6
and ankyrin-G immunohistochemistry, and NEURON compartmental modelling) they show that AIS
morphology and sodium channel density are the primary determinants of maximum firing rate and
depolarisation-block threshold.

The methodology is carefully matched: the same OFF-alphaT cell population is characterised
electrophysiologically, anatomically, and computationally. Dorsal and ventral retinal
locations are compared because prior work showed that OFF-alphaT cells receive different
synaptic drive in these regions; the intrinsic-biophysics question is whether the output side
is also tuned. The compartmental model serves as a mechanistic bridge, varying only AIS
parameters while holding dendritic and somatic properties constant, to test whether AIS alone
can explain the observed firing-rate differences.

The headline quantitative results are a 7x AIS-to-soma Na+ density ratio, a systematic
AIS-length difference between dorsal and ventral OFF-alphaT cells, and the demonstration that
AIS length alone is sufficient to reproduce the firing-rate and depolarisation-block
differences in the compartmental model. Dorsal cells have longer AISs and sustain higher
firing rates; ventral cells have shorter AISs and enter depolarisation block at lower input
currents.

For this project, the implications are direct. DSGC compartmental models must include an
explicit AIS compartment with Nav1.6 enrichment at the reported density ratio, AIS length
should be a named tunable parameter constrained by immunohistochemistry rather than a fixed
value, and depolarisation-block behaviour must be used as a fitting constraint. Ignoring the
AIS will produce a DSGC model that cannot correctly reproduce high-firing-rate and
strong-contrast responses.

This eLife paper asks a specific question about retinal direction selectivity: at what spatial
scale is the direction-selective computation actually performed inside the dendrites of an
ON-OFF DSGC? The question is motivated by decades of theoretical work (Koch, Poggio & Torre
1982; Schachter et al. 2010) proposing dendritic subunits on a 50–100 µm scale, by anatomical
evidence that starburst amacrine cells wrap varicosities around DSGC dendrites with
direction-dependent orientation (Briggman et al. 2011), and by earlier patch-clamp results
(Sivyer & Williams 2013) suggesting subthreshold local tuning. The authors set out to measure
that spatial scale directly in an intact mouse retina.

Their methodology combines two-photon Ca²⁺ imaging of small (3–4 µm) dendritic ROIs in
OGB-1-loaded DSGCs with voltage-gated Na⁺ channel blockade (intracellular QX-314 or bath TTX),
pharmacological dissection of NMDA receptors (D-AP5), genetic disruption of GABA release from
starburst amacrine cells (vGAT-KO), mechanical ablation of individual SACs via sharp-electrode
lesions, and a multi-compartmental NEURON model of a reconstructed DSGC with 177 E/I synaptic
pairs and stochastic release. The combination of imaging, targeted circuit perturbation, and
biophysical simulation is the paper's methodological core.

The headline findings are that DS information exists and is independently generated inside
5–10 µm dendritic segments — an order of magnitude smaller than classic cable-theory
estimates; that noise correlations between dendritic ROIs fall off with a 5.3 µm space
constant; that dendritic Ca²⁺ tuning matches somatic spiking tuning and is sharper than
subthreshold somatic voltage; that NMDA receptors scale responses multiplicatively without
altering PD or DSI; that ablating just 3–7 null-side SACs selectively disrupts DS at
interspersed dendritic hot spots leaving other segments intact; and that a soft dendritic
voltage threshold in the CaV activation range (−55 to −48 mV) is sufficient in the model to
convert homogeneously-tuned inputs into strongly-tuned, locally-independent compartments.

For this project the paper is central. It pins down the empirical target that an ON-OFF DSGC
compartmental model must reproduce: sharp somatic directional tuning that emerges from many
small, locally-tuned dendritic segments whose independence is enforced by dendritic threshold
nonlinearities and by spatially-precise GABAergic inhibition. It also supplies an explicit set
of channel conductances, a morphology reference (Poleg-Polsky & Diamond 2016), a ratio of 1:1
excitatory-to-inhibitory synapse count (177 each), and a concrete prediction — active
dendritic Na⁺/K⁺ channels are expected to sharpen tuning — that we will test directly as part
of our active-vs-passive dendrite experiment. The measured DSI distribution, angular SD of
~32°, and 5–10 µm compartment scale give us quantitative benchmarks to score candidate model
configurations against.

Hanson et al. revisit one of the most entrenched assumptions in retinal neuroscience: that
direction selectivity in direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) is inherited from
the directionally tuned GABA release of starburst amacrine cells. They ask whether DSGCs can
still compute direction when starburst output itself is no longer directional, a question made
answerable for the first time by combining the Gabra2 conditional KO (which removes mutual SAC
inhibition) with optogenetic stimulation of SACs while bipolar-cell drive is pharmacologically
silenced.

Methodologically, the study integrates four approaches: cell-specific genetics to control SAC
inhibition, ChR2 optogenetics to control excitation of SACs in isolation, whole-cell and loose
cell-attached patch-clamp recordings to read out EPSCs, IPSCs, and spiking in the same DSGCs,
and a multicompartmental NEURON model (built on the Poleg-Polsky and Diamond 2016 DSGC
morphology) to test the computational sufficiency of the proposed mechanisms. Pharmacology
(hexamethonium, SR-95531, DL-AP4, UBP310, CNQX, D-AP5) isolates cholinergic, GABAergic, and
glutamatergic components. Modelling synapses and somatic Na/K/delayed-rectifier conductances
are set to densities matched to prior literature, and release probabilities are parameterised
sigmoidally with direction.

The central findings are that (i) starburst IPSC direction selectivity can be essentially
abolished (DSI about 0.07) while DSGC spiking remains robustly directional; (ii) the residual
DS is explained by a directionally tuned excitation-inhibition temporal offset of up to 50 ms
in the preferred direction, which corresponds to a relatively fixed 25-30 microm spatial
offset across velocities; (iii) this offset is cholinergic in origin, since hexamethonium
delays preferred-direction EPSCs by about 25 ms and collapses the offset; and (iv) the two DS
mechanisms (amplitude and timing) dominate different phases of the response: offsets sharpen
the early phase, amplitude differences broaden and stabilise the peak phase. The NEURON model
reproduces all of these features under both full and reduced wiring.

For this project, Hanson et al. 2019 is directly relevant on three fronts. First, it
constrains the target tuning curve: a single trial-averaged angle-to-AP-frequency curve is
unlikely to capture the dual-mechanism structure, so the target should ideally include
early-versus-peak temporal structure. Second, it provides a specific, reconstructed, publicly
available NEURON model (`geoffder/Spatial-Offset-DSGC-NEURON-Model`) with the exact
conductance recipe, passive properties, and distributed AMPA/ACh/GABA synapses needed as a
baseline for the morphology/conductance/input parametric variation planned here. Third, it
establishes that any realistic DSGC model in this project must treat excitation as two
distinct populations (bipolar AMPA and starburst ACh) with different spatial offsets, because
their differential timing is itself a DS mechanism that must be represented if the optimiser
is to fit mouse DSGC behaviour rather than a generic ON-OFF ganglion cell.

Dan, Hopp, Borst and Segev (2018) resolve the long-standing question of how the ~400–600
motion-sensitive dendritic branchlets of a blowfly VS tangential cell are integrated into the
cell's single direction-selective axonal output. They combine two prior *in vivo* datasets —
axonal intracellular recordings and branchlet-level Ca2+ imaging — and fuse them onto six
prototypical 3D reconstructions of VS1, VS2, VS3, VS4, VS5 and VS9 cells by exploiting the
morphological stereotypy of VS cells across specimens. The fused dataset yields up to 116
local receptive fields on a single prototype, enabling the first quantitative test of the rule
by which dendritic RFs are combined into the axonal RF.

The methodology is a steady-state passive cable / compartmental model in NEURON with fixed Rm
= 2,000 Ω·cm² and Ri = 40 Ω·cm and no free parameters. For each branchlet they compute the
electrotonic distance (x/λ), the local input resistance (8–13 MΩ), and — crucially — the
branchlet-to-axon transfer resistance (2.4–3.0 MΩ range, ~20% variability within a cell). They
then compare two integration rules against the experimentally measured axonal receptive field:
uniform average (the null model from Hopp et al.) versus transfer-resistance-weighted average.
A supplementary threshold non-linearity that filters out the smallest dendritic vectors is
added on top.

The headline result is that TR-weighted summation significantly outperforms uniform summation:
for VS5 the difference index drops from 0.411 to 0.293, with the improvement exceeding 2 SD of
a shuffled-weights null distribution. Adding the non-linearity improves the fit further to DI
= 0.283 (VS3), 0.236 (VS4), 0.280 (VS5). Separately, the full inter-branchlet TR matrix (3–4
MΩ) is much smaller than the local branchlet input resistance (8–13 MΩ), establishing that
VS-cell dendritic branchlets are **electrically decoupled and function as independent local
subunits**. The effective membrane time constant (<2 ms) is much shorter than the
motion-detector input timescale, validating the steady-state approximation.

For this literature survey, the paper is included as a borderline entry: it is a single-
morphology-per-cell-type passive-cable study of an invertebrate visual neuron, not a
morphology-variant sweep (the earlier task brief mis-attributed it as "Haag2018 — 200
morphology variants", which was wrong). It is nonetheless a strong reference for (a)
transfer-resistance weighting as the correct passive rule for many-to-one dendritic
integration, (b) the independent-subunit architecture as a passively-derivable property of
dendritic trees, and (c) the methodological pattern of fusing branchlet-level imaging across
specimens onto a prototypical morphology. Translation to vertebrate retinal DSGCs requires
adjusting for active dendritic mechanisms and gap-junctional network effects (the authors flag
axo-axonal coupling between neighboring VS cells, coupling coefficients up to 50%, as one
reason their fit is not perfect), but the core TR-weighting result is a morphology-agnostic
passive-cable prediction that any compartmental DSGC model should reproduce as a baseline
before invoking active conductances.

This paper asks how direction selectivity is implemented in Drosophila T4 neurons, the first
site in the fly ON motion pathway where directionally selective signals appear. The motivation
is to resolve which of the classical algorithmic motion detectors \u2014
Hassenstein\u2013Reichardt multiplication, Barlow\u2013Levick veto, or an Adelson\u2013Bergen
motion-energy filter \u2014 the fly circuit actually implements. The authors focus on T4
because prior calcium-imaging evidence had been ambiguous: the indicator is blind to
hyperpolarization and too slow to resolve the sub- ommatidial timing differences that would
distinguish these models.

Methodologically, the study combines targeted in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp of GFP-labelled
T4 cells (n = 17) with a biophysical, compartmental model of a single T4 cell whose morphology
was reconstructed from Janelia FlyEM FIB-SEM. They map the receptive field with
single-position bar flashes and with two-step apparent-motion pairs, extract per-position
onset-time and decay-time, and then fit a passive conductance-based model (99 excitatory and
55 inhibitory synapses on a 344-section dendrite) to the stationary SPFRs. They test
generalization by predicting moving-bar responses the model never saw, and they run three
clean model ablations: remove inhibition, collapse all synapses to the dendritic base, and
replace the whole cell with a single compartment.

The headline findings are that T4's direction selectivity arises from spatially offset fast
excitatory and delayed inhibitory inputs (approximately 6\u00B0 E\u2013I offset along the
PD\u2013ND axis) with invariant excitatory onset times across the receptive field, so there is
no HR-style delay line. Two-step apparent motion produces pure null-direction suppression (DSI
approximately 0.46 on the trailing side versus DSI approximately 0.03 on the leading side),
with no preferred- direction enhancement. The conductance-based model reproduces DSI vs speed
quantitatively for moving stimuli; removing inhibition abolishes DSI at every speed; and
\u2014 critically for morphology-modelling work \u2014 collapsing all synapses to the
dendritic base or using a single- compartment variant reproduces the full-dendrite DSI almost
exactly. The T4 arbor's role is therefore input sampling, not nonlinear integration.

For this project's literature survey on morphology-to-DS modelling, this is the canonical
invertebrate reference and a strong null result: the morphology-related variable that drives
DS in T4 is not dendritic cable geometry but the 1D spatial layout of excitatory and
inhibitory inputs along the PD\u2013ND dendritic axis, combined with a dynamic passive
shunting nonlinearity. That gives our compartmental RGC model a precise contrastive
hypothesis: if dendritic morphology contributes to DS beyond input layout in vertebrate DSGCs,
it must do so via active conductances, asymmetric passive cable properties, or structured
dendritic branching that goes beyond the mechanisms sufficient for T4. We should reuse
Gruntman et al.'s SPFR-to-moving-bar generalization protocol, their DSI = (R_PD \u2212 R_ND) /
R_PD convention, and their collapse-to-base vs full-arbor ablation design as template
comparisons in our own modelling work.

Bittner and colleagues (2017) discover a new form of synaptic plasticity in hippocampal area
CA1 that operates on the behavioral time scale (seconds) and is driven by dendritic plateau
potentials. Using in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp from CA1 pyramidal neurons during running on
a linear treadmill, the authors combine natural observation of spontaneous plateaus with
artificial plateau induction (via somatic current injection) paired with Schaffer-collateral
stimulation.

The methodology systematically varies the temporal offset between the plateau and the pairing
synaptic input, mapping the BTSP time window. Compartmental modelling and pharmacological
block of NMDA receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels identify the mechanistic substrate
as a calcium-activated intracellular eligibility trace that persists for seconds after a
plateau.

The central finding is that a single plateau, paired with running, is sufficient to create a
place field in one trial. The BTSP time window extends approximately plus-or-minus 1-2 seconds
on either side of the plateau, is symmetric (non-Hebbian), and does not require classical
pre-before-post spike pairing. Place-field half-width is approximately 1.5-2 seconds (about
15-20 cm at typical mouse speeds). Plateau potentials themselves are 30-60 mV in amplitude,
50-300 ms in duration, and require EC3 input to the apical tuft plus active NMDA conductances.

For the DSGC modelling programme this paper is important in two ways. First, it generalizes
plateau-driven dendritic computation beyond Larkum-style cortical BAC firing to a hippocampal
place-field mechanism, establishing plateaus as a cross-cell-type computational motif. Second,
the quantitative BTSP rule (symmetric, seconds-wide, plateau-gated) provides a candidate
mechanism that DSGC models could test: if DSGC dendrites can host brief plateau-like
depolarisations during preferred-direction motion, these could in principle gate
direction-selective plasticity on a behaviorally relevant timescale. Whether DSGC dendritic
geometry (short, non-tufted, compact) supports such plateaus is an open empirical question
that follow-up compartmental simulation can address.

Vlasits et al. (2016) address a longstanding question in retinal direction selectivity:
whether the *location* of excitatory inputs along a starburst amacrine cell dendrite matters,
separately from morphology and network inhibition. They combine four experimental techniques —
visual receptive field mapping with spots and rings, MNI-glutamate uncaging, PSD95-YFP genetic
labeling, and re-analysis of the Briggman et al. connectome — to show that excitatory bipolar
inputs are concentrated on the proximal ~70% of the SAC dendrite, while neurotransmitter
release sites (varicosities) occupy the distal third. Inputs and outputs are spatially
displaced.

Methodologically, the authors build a passive ball-and-stick NEURON model of a reconstructed
SAC dendrite and drive it with simulated moving bars under four synaptic-input distributions
matched in total synapse count and mean density but differing only in spatial placement: the
empirical skewed distribution and a symmetric full-length distribution, each in two variants.
This **morphology-matched symmetric-input control** isolates the effect of input geometry from
cable properties, producing a clean comparison that has become the reference design in the
field. Two-photon Ca2+ imaging of individual varicosities and pharmacological isolation of the
GABA-A component provide the in-tissue test of the model predictions.

The key finding is that the measured proximal-restricted input distribution produces robust
outward-motion-preferring voltage at the distal release zone (varicosity DSI = 0.34 ± 0.23, n
= 25), whereas a density-matched symmetric input distribution does not. Only ~25% of
DSGC-directed release sites overlap with the excitatory receptive field. GABA-A blockade with
gabazine reduces but does not abolish the computation, confirming that dendritic mechanisms
and circuit inhibition act synergistically. Adding voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to the
varicosities amplifies DS multiplicatively but is not required to generate it.

For this project literature survey on how morphology-driven models shape DS, Vlasits2016 is
the canonical reference for two reasons. First, it is the clearest demonstration that
synaptic-input spatial statistics are a morphology-independent degree of freedom that must be
respected by any compartmental DS model. Second, its morphology-matched symmetric-input design
is the methodological template we should import when our own tasks compare cable theory, input
placement, and active channels as DS determinants. Any compartmental SAC or DSGC model we
build that matches morphology alone but ignores input placement should be expected to
underestimate DS or distribute DS incorrectly across the dendrite, and the numerical targets
in this paper (varicosity DSI ~ 0.3, input field extending to ~70% of dendritic radius, ~25%
input-output overlap) are the benchmarks our simulations should hit.

This Technology Report introduces BluePyOpt, a Python package developed at the Blue Brain
Project to standardise the multi-objective evolutionary optimisation of neuroscience models.
The motivation is that while stochastic search methods like genetic algorithms and CMA-ES have
proven effective for fitting compartmental neuron models, configuring them correctly remains a
domain expertise problem that excludes most neuroscientists from the technique. BluePyOpt
addresses this by providing a reusable object-oriented API and turn-key cloud-deployment
scripts, lowering the barrier so that a working optimisation can be expressed in a short
Python script.

The framework wraps DEAP for the evolutionary algorithms (IBEA, NSGA-II, CMA-ES, PSO), NEURON
for electrophysiological simulation, and eFEL for feature extraction. Its core abstraction is
a clean separation between an `Optimisation` (the search algorithm), an `Evaluator` (the
parameter-to- objective mapping), and an `ephys` model layer (`CellModel`, `Morphology`,
`Mechanism`, `Protocol`, `Stimulus`, `Recording`, `eFELFeature`, `SingletonObjective`,
`ObjectivesCalculator`). Distance- dependent ion-channel distributions, parameter freezing,
holding currents, and back-propagating- AP protocols are all first-class API objects.
Parallelisation is handled by user-supplied `map` functions (Python, multiprocessing, SCOOP,
MPI4Py); Ansible playbooks automate AWS, Vagrant, and cluster deployment.

The paper validates the framework on three representative use cases. A single-compartment
Hodgkin-Huxley fit converges in 4 minutes on one CPU. A 18-parameter, 31-feature optimisation
of a layer-5 pyramidal cell reproduces the published Markram et al. 2015 model in
approximately 4 hours on 50 cores, recovering a diverse hall-of-fame of equally good
solutions. A 9-parameter calcium-based STDP model is fit to LTP/LTD curves from Nevian and
Sakmann (2006), demonstrating that the framework is not restricted to voltage-trace fitting.

For this project, BluePyOpt is the methodology backbone of the parameter-optimisation work.
The paper is the canonical citation for the project's chosen optimisation toolchain, sitting
alongside Druckmann et al. (2007) and Hay et al. (2011) as the methodological core. It
directly specifies the recommended adoption pattern: encode each project objective (DSI
matching, target firing rates, EPSP/IPSP amplitudes) as an `eFELFeature` plus
`SingletonObjective`, package the model as a `CellModel` with `Protocol` per stimulus
condition, and run IBEA or NSGA-II via DEAP. The L5PC compute budget and the reported
non-uniqueness of solutions also set practical expectations for this project's own
optimisation runs and for how to interpret their output as a population of
electrophysiological regimes rather than a single best individual.

Poleg-Polsky and Diamond investigate how direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) in the
mouse retina amplify visual signals while preserving reliable directional tuning. The central
question is why NMDA receptors are present on DSGC dendrites when direction selectivity can be
computed without them. The answer proposed is that NMDARs provide multiplicative gain --
scaling responses in both the preferred and null directions by the same factor -- which
maintains the direction-selectivity index, increases absolute signal amplitude, and improves
resistance to visual noise.

The experiments combine whole-cell patch-clamp from GFP-labeled DRD4 mouse DSGCs with a
morphologically realistic multicompartmental NEURON model containing 177 AMPAR + 177 NMDAR +
177 GABA_A synapses on reconstructed ON dendrites. Slope-angle analysis distinguishes
multiplicative from additive NMDAR scaling. Two pharmacological manipulations convert
multiplication to addition: removing voltage-dependent Mg2+ block and reversing GABAergic
inhibition to excitation with high-Cl- internal solution. The NEURON model replicates all
experimental PSP and AP responses and predicts additive NMDAR scaling under both
pharmacological conditions.

The key finding is that NMDAR multiplication requires the conjunction of voltage-dependent
NMDAR conductance and directionally tuned GABAergic inhibition. Under noiseless conditions,
NMDAR blockade preserves DSI but reduces AP firing amplitude. Under noisy conditions, ROC
analysis demonstrates significantly better signal discrimination with intact NMDARs than with
AP5 or 0 Mg2+. Dendritic spikes were absent in DRD4 DSGCs; passive propagation proved
sufficient for DS computation.

For this project, the Poleg-Polsky & Diamond NEURON model is the essential template. Its
geometry (single reconstructed DRD4 DSGC), synaptic counts (177 AMPA + 177 GABA on ON
dendrites), and circuit architecture (tuned GABAergic inhibition as stronger ND conductance)
directly match the planned implementation. Available on ModelDB (accession 189347). The paper
validates passive- dendrite sufficiency for project RQ4, constrains NMDAR conductance
Mg2+-block parameters, and establishes ROC accuracy-curve area as the appropriate metric for
comparing DS tuning fidelity across model variants.

Poleg-Polsky and Diamond ask how the retinal direction-selective circuit, which is organized
as a feedforward inhibitory microcircuit (bipolar cell → starburst amacrine cell →
direction-selective ganglion cell), keeps its excitation / inhibition ratio stable across a
wide contrast range even though the SAC interposes a highly nonlinear dendritic release step.
Using whole-cell recordings, pharmacology, two-photon Ca2+ imaging, and iGluSnFR in mouse
retina, they show that the DSGC E/I ratio is indeed contrast-independent (r = 0.94) and that
this is not because of postsynaptic receptor differences between cholinergic, NMDAR and AMPAR
components, which all share the same contrast sensitivity.

The compensating mechanism lives in the bipolar-cell layer: BCs that drive SACs are far more
contrast-sensitive (detection threshold ~16 % contrast, half-activation ~32 %) than BCs that
drive DSGCs (threshold ~65 %). Direct imaging of SAC dendritic Ca2+ shows that the SAC I/O
transform is steeply sigmoidal (threshold ~38 %, half-activation ~66 %), so the elevated
presynaptic sensitivity of SAC-targeting BCs exactly offsets the SAC nonlinearity, leaving the
feedforward GABAergic output at the DSGC contrast-matched to the direct BC → DSGC excitation.
Single-bouton recordings show this sensitivity difference is between BC subtypes, not within
them, and correlates with distinct IPL stratification.

A stochastic compartmental DSGC model (121 ON-layer compartments; AMPA, NMDA and GABA
conductances with realistic kinetics and Jahr-Stevens NMDA voltage dependence; Hodgkin-Huxley
spike generator) is used to show that matched E/I contrast tuning maximizes suprathreshold
DSI. Shifting E or I along the contrast axis either leaks non-directional null responses
through the circuit or quenches spikes altogether, confirming that the presynaptic
BC-heterogeneity mechanism is functionally necessary, not merely present.

For this project the paper is a **borderline** but important inclusion. The morphology of the
DSGC is held fixed and the primary contribution is circuit-level, so it is not a
morphology-on-DS modeling paper in the strict sense. However, the compartmental DSGC model
with spatially distributed E and I inputs, and the explicit demonstration that the
*distribution* of E/I contrast tuning across dendritic compartments gates reliable DS
computation, make this a key reference for how E/I-on-morphology shapes DS. It should be cited
alongside PolegPolsky2026 when arguing that DSGC dendritic biophysics and synaptic spatial
statistics — not just SAC wiring — determine direction-selective reliability, and its synapse
parameterization can be reused as a validated starting point for our own DSGC simulations.

Ding et al. use serial block-face EM to reconstruct the complete synaptic wiring of four
starburst amacrine cells in mouse retina and compare it with the previously characterised
rabbit circuit. The central finding is that mouse SACs receive inhibitory SAC-SAC inputs
exclusively on their proximal dendrites, whereas rabbit SACs receive them distally. The study
is motivated by the need to understand which circuit features -- intrinsic or network-based --
account for direction selectivity of SAC dendrites, and whether that organisation varies
across species.

To interpret the anatomy, the authors construct a 7-SAC network model in Neuron-C with
anatomically measured dendritic diameters, biophysically grounded active conductances (NaV1.8,
Kdr, L-type Ca^2+), and synapse placements derived from the EM data. Mouse-like (proximal
inhibition, 145 um inter-soma spacing) and rabbit-like (distal inhibition, 200 um spacing)
configurations are compared over stimulus velocities 30-2000 um/s. Two-photon calcium imaging
and SR95531 pharmacology confirm the model predictions in vitro.

Key quantitative results: the mouse model remains DS down to ~100 um/s linear velocity,
matching the smaller mouse eye (3 mm axial diameter, ~30 um/deg) to conserve angular velocity
tuning. Distributing BC inputs uniformly reverses direction preference in the model. SAC-SAC
inhibition is necessary for DS at high contrast (300%) and for DS to centrally restricted
stimuli in mouse. Full biophysical parameters (Rm = 10,000 Ohm-cm^2, Ri = 75 Ohm-cm,
NaV1.8/Kdr/Ca^2+ densities per dendritic zone) are tabulated and distributed with the model
code.

For this project, Ding et al. (2016) provides three concrete resources: (1) a fully described
multi-compartmental DS circuit model with biophysical parameters and DSI protocol that can
directly inform DSGC model parameterisation; (2) a design principle -- restrict excitatory
inputs to proximal zones away from the output zone -- guiding AMPA vs. GABA placement in the
DSGC dendritic model; and (3) mouse-specific synaptic geometry (inhibitory inputs at proximal
third, excitatory at proximal two-thirds) to validate against when choosing GABA input
distributions in the project compartmental DSGC model.

Poleg-Polsky and Diamond ask a methodological question that matters for every modelling paper
built on experimental E/I decomposition: how accurate is the standard protocol of
reconstructing excitatory and inhibitory conductances from multi-holding-potential
voltage-clamp recordings when the cell has thin, extended dendrites? They answer it with
NEURON compartmental simulations of realistic retinal ganglion cell morphologies, where the
ground-truth synaptic input is known and the somatic pipette recording can be directly
compared against it.

The methodology is careful: the authors systematically vary dendritic diameter, synaptic
distance, E/I relative timing, and holding-potential range, and compare each reconstruction
against the known inputs. They also test what happens when voltage-gated dendritic channels
are added. The design isolates space-clamp error from other confounds (series resistance,
filtering, ionic non-stationarity) and lets the reader see exactly which experimental choices
drive the largest distortions.

The headline result is that imperfect space clamp is not a second-order concern: on thin
distal dendrites up to 80% of the synaptic signal is lost, inhibitory estimates are
systematically worse than excitatory ones, and co-active E and I interact electrotonically so
that reconstructing one requires correctly modelling the other. Active dendritic channels make
everything worse. The paper practical guidance (proximal-only reconstruction,
compartmental-model validation of each experiment) is now standard.

For this project, the implication is direct. DSGC models will be calibrated against published
Ge and Gi traces from somatic voltage-clamp recordings, and those traces are lower bounds on
the true dendritic conductances, not ground truth. Our NEURON pipeline must include a somatic
voltage-clamp block so that simulated recordings can be compared to experimental recordings on
the same footing, and we must plan parameter-fitting procedures to absorb a several-fold
calibration uncertainty on distal synaptic conductance amplitudes.

Hay et al. (2011) address a long-standing gap in compartmental modeling of L5b cortical
pyramidal cells: no published model simultaneously reproduced the perisomatic Na+ step-current
f-I behavior and the BAP-activated dendritic Ca2+ ("BAC") firing observed in adult-rat slice
recordings. The paper's research question is whether a single conductance-based model in a
reconstructed morphology can be fit to both regimes with experimentally measured cell-to-cell
variability, and which channel densities and Ca2+-dynamics parameters are necessary or
sufficient for each regime.

Methodologically, the authors define 20 firing features (10 perisomatic, 10 BAC), each with an
experimental mean and SD computed across several cells. They use multi-objective optimization
with an elitist non-dominated sorting evolutionary algorithm — population 1000, 500
generations, 240 to 1024 CPU cores, 2-5 days runtime — to optimize 22 free parameters. The
free parameters are the maximal densities of nine ion channels (Nat, Nap, Kp, Kt, Kv3.1,
Ca_HVA, Ca_LVA, SK, Im) in soma and apical compartments, plus the Ca2+ buffer parameters gamma
and tdecay. The Ih distribution is fixed to preserve subthreshold properties. Models are
accepted when every feature falls within 2-3 SD of the experimental mean. Mechanism kinetics
use Hodgkin-Huxley formalism with Q10 = 2.3 and a -10 mV junction-potential shift where
applicable.

The headline result is a set of about 2000 acceptable L5b PC models published in ModelDB
(accession 139653). Single-target fits are easier (899 BAC-only, 52 perisomatic-only) but
typically fail the other target. Joint fits achieve every feature within 2-3 SD: e.g. BAP
amplitude **45 +/- 10 mV** at 620 um, Ca2+ spike peak **6.73 +/- 2.54 mV**, perisomatic spike
frequencies of **9 / 14.5 / 22.5 Hz**, AP half-width of **1.31 ms**, slow AHP depth around
**-60 mV**. Cross-target parameter analysis identifies apical Nat and apical Kv3.1 densities
as the dominant levers controlling BAP propagation, and shows that morphology swaps degrade
BAC features more than perisomatic features.

For this project, Hay 2011 is a direct upstream dependency of t0074 and t0078: the SK_E2 and
CaDynamics_E2 MOD files vendored under t0074 originate here, and t0078's `tau_ca_multiplier`
extension to CaDynamics_E2 is an additional knob on the same gamma + tdecay sub-membrane shell
formalism defined in this paper. The cited parameter ranges (gamma in 0.0005-0.05; soma tdecay
20-1000 ms; apical tdecay 20-200 ms) provide the prior box that t0078's MOBO should explore.
The multi-objective + per-feature-SD scoring + Pareto-acceptable-ensemble methodology is also
the template t0078 inherits for reporting and analyzing its own MOBO results. Citing Hay 2011
in the t0078 substrate documentation is therefore mandatory.

Sengupta, Stemmler, Laughlin and Niven (2010) ask whether the per-action-potential energy cost
of biological neurons is set by waveform alone, or whether the underlying ionic currents allow
large cost differences hidden by similar AP shapes. They re-implement seven published
Hodgkin-Huxley single-compartment models spanning the squid giant axon, a crab leg motor
neuron, four mammalian neurons (mouse fast-spiking interneuron, rat hippocampal interneuron,
rat cerebellar granule cell, mouse thalamo-cortical relay) and a honeybee Kenyon cell, and
compare per-AP Na+ loads on a common, model-independent basis. The motivation is to establish
a principled per-cell-type energy metric that can serve as a bottom-up calibration anchor for
cortical energy budgets and for downstream modelers comparing their own neurons energy use to
literature.

The methodology is a deterministic single-compartment HH simulation driven by constant
injected current to elicit repetitive firing, with per-AP Na+ load computed by integrating the
inward Na+ current over one limit-cycle period. Cost is converted to ATP using the 3 Na+/ATP
stoichiometry of the Na+/K+ pump. The authors then introduce a five-parameter constrained
optimization (gNa, gK, tau_m, tau_h, tau_n) that combines a Nelder-Mead simplex with a
Newton-method hill climber, enforcing AP existence by a hard penalty and AP height by a soft
quadratic loss. Conductances and time constants are bounded to 30-400% of the original
published values. The same optimization is run across six of the seven models, and the changes
in parameters are compared.

The headline result is that the per-AP Na+ load varies 17-fold across the seven models, while
the capacitive-minimum Na+ load varies only 2.3-fold; the difference is almost entirely the
overlap load, which has a linear correlation R^2 = 0.99 with the total Na+ load (slope ~ 1).
Mammalian neurons (RG, RHI, MTCR) operate near the capacitive minimum (efficiency ~ 75-100%,
alpha ~ 1.0-1.3), while the squid axon at 6.3 degrees C is profligate (efficiency 9%, alpha =
11.2). Constrained optimization reduces the squid Na+ load 4.2-fold while leaving the mouse
thalamo-cortical neuron essentially unchanged, confirming that mammalian APs already sit close
to a local optimum. Optimized parameter changes vary qualitatively across models: each model
has its own local energy valley.

For this project, the paper is the canonical citation for the per-AP energy objective in the
t0097 multi-objective optimization catalogue. The energy recipe `int(I_Na) dt / 3` (per
compartment, per AP, in ATP molecules) is exactly what t0097 will report alongside the
angle-tuning loss as a co-objective in the NSGA-II Pareto search. The Na+ overlap factor alpha
is the natural normalized cost metric for cross-neuron comparison, and the mammalian alpha
range of 1.0-1.5 calibrated here sets the realistic biological lower bound for any DSGC
compartmental model. The model-dependence of optimal parameter changes also reinforces the
project preference for a population-based ranking search (NSGA-II) over a one-shot template,
since each DSGC morphology will see a different energy landscape under the joint angle-tuning
+ energy objective.

Branco, Clark, and Häusser ask whether individual cortical dendrites can detect the temporal
order of their synaptic inputs — a computation previously assumed to require networks of
neurons. Using multi-site two-photon glutamate uncaging in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of rat
somatosensory and visual cortex, they show that single dendrites produce systematically larger
somatic EPSPs and higher spike probabilities when synapses are activated from the branch tip
toward the soma ("IN") than from soma to tip ("OUT"), and that local dendritic Ca2+ signals
carry the same directionality. The finding scales up: neurons can also discriminate arbitrary
random temporal sequences delivered to a single dendrite or distributed across multiple
dendrites.

The mechanism is revealed by pharmacology and a compartmental model. Blocking NMDA receptors
with D-AP5 abolishes supralinear summation (response drops from **223 ± 9%** to **103 ± 3%**
of linear sum) and the directional asymmetry (IN-OUT difference shrinks from **2.8 mV** to
**0.4 mV**). The compartmental model with passive dendrites and AMPA+NMDA synapses fully
reproduces direction sensitivity, identifying the mechanism as the interaction between the
dendritic impedance gradient (high distally, low proximally) and the voltage-dependent Mg2+
block of NMDA receptors. Sequences initiated distally depolarise more locally, progressively
relieving Mg2+ block and generating a regenerative NMDAR cascade that is absent in the
distal-to-proximal direction.

The paper's headline results are: IN responses **31 ± 4%** larger than OUT (n = 20); spike
probability **38 ± 9%** higher; Ca2+ signals **48 ± 13%** larger; random pattern
discrimination probability **40%** (> 1 mV, n = 7); multi-dendrite sequence discrimination
**4.0 ± 1.3 mV** (n = 5). All effects are abolished by D-AP5 or hyperpolarisation. The
mechanism is confirmed in layer 5 pyramidal neurons and hippocampal dentate gyrus granule
cells.

For this project, Branco et al. (2010) provides the mechanistic logic for dendritic direction
selectivity in the compartmental model: the impedance gradient combined with NMDA receptor
non-linearity converts a spatiotemporal sweep of synaptic activation into a directionally
tuned output. Although the paper uses cortical pyramidal neurons, the mechanism explicitly
generalises to any neuron with an impedance gradient and NMDAR-containing synapses, including
DSGCs. The ModelDB 140828 NEURON implementation offers directly reusable AMPA+NMDA synapse
code, the ~2–3 µm/ms optimal velocity sets a wave-sweep parameter target, and the D-AP5
results provide a clear internal control for validating the synaptic component of the DSGC
model.

Schachter, Oesch, Smith & Taylor (2010) ask how the rabbit On-Off direction-selective ganglion
cell converts weakly directionally tuned synaptic input (PSP DSI ~0.2) into strongly tuned
spike output (spike DSI ~0.8). The scope is a single-cell biophysical explanation: given the
known circuitry (starburst amacrine cells providing presynaptic DS, spatially offset
postsynaptic inhibition) and the known cell (anatomical DSGC morphology with active
dendrites), can the measured transformation be reproduced, and what is each mechanism
contribution? This is motivated by prior in vitro evidence from Oesch et al. (2005) that each
somatic spike is triggered by a dendritic spike, and by the unresolved question of whether
postsynaptic inhibition alone can account for DS.

The methodology is a NeuronC compartmental simulation of a reconstructed DSGC with
Hodgkin-Huxley Na, Kv, Kv4, and Ca channels in the dendrites and soma, driven by AMPA-like
excitatory and GABA-A-like inhibitory synapses whose conductances and timings match published
voltage-clamp data. Stimulation protocols include single-synapse threshold mapping, paired
excitation+inhibition titration, and full 12-direction drifting-bar experiments. Key design
decisions include electrically compartmentalizing the dendrites via high Rm and thin distal
branches (Rin >1 GOhm), using uniform or graded dendritic gNa (**40 mS/cm^2** or **45 to 20
mS/cm^2**), and systematically removing each DS mechanism to isolate its contribution.

The headline results are that local dendritic spike thresholds act as ~4x nonlinear amplifiers
of PSP-level DS; that physiological inhibition (**~4-10 nS**) can prevent spike initiation but
cannot block propagation (which would require ~85 nS); that presynaptic DS from SACs is the
more robust mechanism across the arbor while postsynaptic inhibition dominates only at distal
tips; and that an intrinsic dendritic geometric effect actually opposes the desired DS on the
preferred side, requiring network DS to be strong enough to overcome it. Somatic voltage-clamp
additionally underestimates distal conductances by 40-100%.

For the present project compartmental modeling of DSGCs, this paper provides a concrete
reference design (channel densities, synapse conductances, inhibition placement, morphology
source) and three load-bearing predictions to reproduce: (i) the 4x amplification of DSI from
PSPs to spikes via dendritic Na, (ii) the initiation-vs-propagation asymmetry for inhibition,
and (iii) the compartmentalized-subunit structure of the tree. It also establishes that
presynaptic DS cannot be omitted from a DSGC model intended to match physiological spike
tuning and gives quantitative guidance on how to calibrate voltage-clamp-derived conductances
for use in simulation.

Fohlmeister, Cohen, and Newman ask how ion channels are distributed across the dendrites,
soma, initial segment, and axon of rat and cat retinal ganglion cells, and how that
distribution must be scaled with temperature to reproduce whole-cell action-potential trains
across 7-37 C. The question matters because single-compartment or under-constrained
multicompartment models of RGCs have historically suffered from parameter degeneracy: many
G-bar maps can fit a recording at one temperature, and the community lacked a principled,
temperature-transferable channel set.

Methodologically, the authors record repetitive spiking in anatomically reconstructed rat Type
I and Type II and cat alpha and beta RGCs at multiple temperatures, then fit phase plots
(dV/dt versus V) of each cell with NEURON multicompartment simulations of the
Fohlmeister-Miller Five-channel model (Na, K(DR), Ca, K(A), K(Ca)). The crucial design choice
is to demand that a single G-bar map fit every temperature simultaneously, so temperature
becomes an identifiability lever, and to separate gating-kinetic Q10s from ion-permeability
Q10s in a GHK-style current equation.

They find that the voltage dependence of rate constants is constant within 7-23 C and within
30-37 C with a sharp transition at 23-30 C; that gating Q10s are ~1.9-1.95 and permeability
Q10s are ~1.5-1.65 above 23 C but climb toward ~8 below 10 C; and that Na channels become
non-Arrhenius below 8 C, with spike failure below 7 C. Peak Na conductance is concentrated on
a thin axonal segment 50-130 um distal to the soma (up to 448 mS/cm^2 in cat alpha), and the
temperature dependence of the IS-SD phase-plot break confirms this localization. A single
cell-type-specific channel map fits all temperatures.

For this project, which is building DSGC compartmental models, this paper is foundational: it
provides a fully calibrated, temperature-scaled Five-channel parameter set for retinal
ganglion cells in rat and cat, including the Na hotspot location, the dendritic Na+K(A) safety
factor, and the two-plateau temperature-scaling scheme. The G-bar tables and Q10 values should
be adopted as the default channel-density prior for DSGC models, modified only where
DSGC-specific evidence demands it, and the phase-plot fitting methodology should be used to
calibrate DSGC compartmental models against future whole-cell recordings.

Cuntz, Forstner, Borst and Häusser propose that the apparent diversity of dendritic
morphologies across cell classes is the solution of a single optimisation problem: given a
target spanning field populated with carrier points, grow a tree that simultaneously minimises
total wiring length (Cajal's cytoplasm conservation) and path length from the root (Cajal's
conduction-time conservation). A single scalar balancing factor `bf` weighs the two costs, and
an extended minimum-spanning-tree algorithm converts the problem into a tractable greedy
construction.

The method is validated on three cell classes that sit in very different corners of morphology
space — fly LPTCs, mammalian CA1 pyramidal neurons, and cerebellar Purkinje cells — by
matching Sholl profiles, branch-order distributions, total dendritic length, and
segment-length statistics between synthetic and reconstructed arbors. The balancing factor
additionally maps onto electrotonic compartmentalisation, linking a single geometric parameter
to cable-theoretic behaviour. The authors release the method as the open-source MATLAB "TREES
toolbox", which also contains morphometric analyses and a semi-automated reconstruction
pipeline from confocal image stacks.

The headline results are quantitative: synthetic trees match total wiring length within a few
percent, reproduce Sholl and branch-order distributions across all three cell classes, and do
so with biologically realistic `bf` clustering at intermediate values (~**0.2-0.7**). The
theory thereby elevates Cajal's qualitative laws into a predictive generator and provides the
first genuinely low-dimensional parametric family of realistic dendritic morphologies.

For this project's literature survey on how morphology shapes direction selectivity, Cuntz2010
is flagged as borderline: it contains no DS experiments or simulations. However, it is the
enabling tool for the sweep-based approach we plan. Its 3-5 Cuntz parameters define a
tractable morphology embedding in which DSI can be evaluated compartmentally, and the mapping
between `bf` and electrotonic compartmentalisation is directly mechanistically relevant to DS
computations that rely on dendritic independence (e.g. starburst amacrine sectors, DSGC
subunit models). It will be cited as the morphology-generation backbone for any
synthetic-arbor DS sweep in the project.

Hausselt, Euler, Detwiler, and Denk (PLoS Biology 2007) ask whether direction selectivity in
mouse retinal starburst amacrine cells is produced by the network of amacrine-cell inhibitory
interactions or by computation intrinsic to a single SAC dendritic tree. They combine somatic
whole-cell recordings during radial circular-wave visual stimulation, two-photon Ca2+ imaging
at dendritic tips, pharmacological block of GABA and glycine receptors, and a morphologically
detailed NEURON compartmental model. The central question has clear consequences for retinal
motion processing, because the answer determines whether the DSGC inherits a pre-computed
directional signal or constructs DS itself from symmetric amacrine input.

Methodologically, the authors isolate the nonlinear component of the somatic response by
Fourier decomposition and report harmonic (F2+) amplitudes rather than raw peak voltages, a
choice that cleanly separates dendritic nonlinearity from passive cable response. The
compartmental model combines reconstructed SAC morphology, tonic AMPA input producing a
soma-to-tip voltage gradient, HVA Ca2+ channels with conventional Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics, and
slow Cl- kinetics, and it sweeps dendritic length as the key geometric parameter.

The headline findings are that the F2/F1 harmonic ratio is 2-3x larger for centrifugal than
centripetal motion, that this asymmetry survives a full GABA-A + GABA-C + glycine block, that
distal dendrites are tonically depolarized by 15-20 mV relative to the soma thanks to tonic
glutamatergic drive, and that abolishing HVA Ca2+ channels with Cd2+ eliminates the DS
harmonic. In simulation, DSI drops from roughly 0.35 at natural (~150 µm) dendrites to roughly
0.12 at shortened (~50 µm) dendrites, establishing dendritic length as a first-order
determinant of DS magnitude, and all three ingredients — gradient, HVA channels, slow Cl-/Ca2+
kinetics — must be present for the full effect.

For this project literature survey on how computational modeling of neuronal morphology shapes
direction selectivity, Hausselt2007 is a foundational anchor despite targeting SACs rather
than DSGCs. It establishes the compartmental-modeling toolkit (NEURON on reconstructed
morphology with tonic synaptic drive and HVA Ca2+ channels), the dendritic-length-versus-DSI
scaling curve that any subsequent SAC or DSGC morphology sweep should benchmark against, and
the SAC-dendrite as autonomous computational unit framing that determines how much of DSGC DS
can be attributed to pre-inherited presynaptic signals. Any DSGC morphology-DS model built
downstream of this work must decide whether to hold the SAC input fixed, re-simulate it with
Hausselt-style biophysics, or abstract it into an effective directional conductance.

Druckmann et al. (2007) confront a methodological problem at the core of conductance-based
neuron modelling: how to automatically fit the maximal-conductance vector of a compartmental
model to noisy in vitro recordings, given that repeated identical current injections produce
visibly different voltage traces in the same cell. They argue that the dominant single-trace,
single-error-function approach is mis-specified - it ignores intrinsic variability and forces
an arbitrary weighting of heterogeneous error terms (e.g. spike timing vs spike shape).

Their solution is a multi-objective optimization framework in which several biophysically
meaningful spike features (rate, width, AHP depth, accommodation, latency, overshoot) are each
assigned their own error function, scored in units of the feature's experimental standard
deviation, and optimized jointly with a custom NSGA-II genetic algorithm running in NEURON.
The fitting target is a compartmental model with 10 somatic ion channels and 12 free
conductance parameters. Convergence was tested on two distinct cortical-interneuron electrical
classes - accommodating and fast-spiking - using 300 organisms and 1000 generations on either
a 112-CPU AMD cluster or a 256-512-processor BlueGene/L.

The framework converges to mean per-feature error of less than 1 SD for both classes and
returns hundreds of "acceptable" parameter sets within 2 SD on every feature. These solution
clouds segregate cleanly along some channels (Nat) and overlap on others (Im, SK), revealing
which conductances actually carry class identity. The Pareto fronts between feature pairs
further expose which objectives genuinely conflict, providing diagnostic information that
single-objective fits would discard. As a proof of generalisation the same recipe with one
extra feature qualitatively captures a third (stuttering) electrical class.

For the present project this paper is the methodology root. Our t0097 catalogue is structured
around multi-objective optimisation of somatic Na/K conductance combinations (and follow-on
dendritic-conductance variants) against a target angle-to-AP-frequency tuning curve in a
direction-selective retinal ganglion cell. Druckmann 2007 supplies (i) the SD-normalised
feature-error formulation that we should mirror when scoring our model against patch-clamp
ground-truth, (ii) the NSGA-II reference cost envelope (300 organisms x 1000 generations) for
budgeting compute, and (iii) the Pareto-of-models output mode, which is more diagnostic than a
single best-fit vector for downstream sensitivity and conductance-class analysis.

Achard and De Schutter ask whether a complex, biophysically detailed compartmental neuron
admits multiple distinct sets of voltage- and calcium-gated channel conductances that
reproduce the cell''s detailed firing behavior. The motivation comes from two convergent lines
of evidence: experimental work on lobster and crab stomatogastric ganglion neurons showing
2-4x interanimal variability in channel expression with preserved activity, and prior
modelling work (Goldman 2001, Prinz 2003-2004) showing parameter degeneracy in low-dimensional
stomatogastric models. The paper extends this question to the cerebellar Purkinje cell -- a
1,600-compartment, 24-parameter model with four firing modes -- and asks both whether
degeneracy exists and what shape the good region of parameter space takes.

The methodology pairs a self-adaptive correlated-mutation evolution strategy ((57+19)
population, ~8,000 evaluations per run, 9 independent runs) with a phase-plane density
distance fitness function summed across 7 current amplitudes, 3 recording sites, and 2 time
windows. Each run took ~6 days on a 10-node G5 cluster. Twenty good solutions are retained
(fitness 2.58 to 3.45). The authors then probe the parameter landscape using single-parameter
sensitivity sweeps, +/-1% and +/-5% local perturbations, pairwise Pearson correlations on
individual and total conductances, and a novel hyperplane visualization that fits
triplet-defined planes and parallel offset planes through the solution cloud.

The 20 models reproduce somatic and dendritic voltage waveforms, complex spike responses, and
EPSP propagation despite the latter two not being in the fitness function. Total conductance
ratios across the 20 models range from 1.2x (gNaF) to 9.7x (gKh). Only 5 of 276 pairwise
correlations are significant at p < 0.01, and only the gCaT-gCaP total-conductance pair shows
a strong anti-correlation (r=-0.62). Local landscape is rough: +/-1% perturbations preserve
fitness, +/-5% can break it. Most importantly, the good region is shown to be a set of loosely
connected hyperplanes -- neither isolated points nor a single connected volume -- and a
6-points-per-dimension grid search would discover at most ~35% of the recovered solutions.

For this project, the paper establishes the methodological line that justifies using
stochastic multi-objective evolutionary search (NSGA-II in our case) on the cell''s
voltage-gated channel parameter space rather than grid sampling, and it establishes that we
should expect families of diverse solutions rather than a unique optimum. The specific
innovations relevant to t0097''s optimization design are: phase-plane or shift-tolerant
fitness as a complement to direct trace-distance metrics; self-adaptive mutation strengths in
the genome; and hyperplane analysis of the recovered Pareto front to understand which
conductance combinations actually trade off. Achard 2006 is the natural methodology citation
alongside Druckmann 2007 and Hay 2011 in this task''s catalogue, providing the earliest
detailed demonstration that complex compartmental models have low-dimensional curved manifolds
of good parameters that only population-based search can recover.

This review by Marder and Goaillard codifies the now-standard observation that nervous-system
variables --- ionic conductances, channel densities, synaptic weights --- vary substantially
across animals of the same species and across cells of the same identified type, while the
behavioural output of single neurons and networks remains conserved. The authors motivate the
question by contrasting protein turnover (minutes to weeks) with neuronal lifetime (years to
decades), arguing that homeostatic mechanisms must continuously rebuild the cell while
preserving its function, and that this rebuilding must necessarily allow for multiple
equivalent parameter configurations.

The paper proceeds methodologically by surveying single-cell electrophysiology paired with
mRNA quantification (Schulz et al. 2006 in pyloric LP neurons; Swensen and Bean 2005 in
cerebellar Purkinje cells), pharmacological vs genetic perturbation studies, and ensemble
conductance-based modelling (Goldman 2001; Golowasch 2002; Prinz, Bucher and Marder 2004). The
synthesis carefully distinguishes timescales (acute pharmacology reveals fragility, chronic
deletion reveals compensation) and scales (single neuron, microcircuit, vertebrate network),
and argues that biological robustness arises through overlapping partially-substitutable
components rather than engineered redundancy.

Quantitatively, the cited evidence shows two- to fourfold inter-animal variation in many ionic
conductances and synaptic strengths, single-cell-level correlation between channel mRNA and
maximal conductance, and the existence of millions of distinct yet behaviourally equivalent
network parameter sets in the lobster pyloric model. The reviews headline conclusion is that
"variability and compensation" are general organising principles of neuronal function, and
that ensemble approaches --- both experimental and computational --- are required to
characterise them.

For this project, this paper is the canonical citation for the *robustness / degeneracy*
objective category in the t0097 multi-objective optimisation catalogue. It directly
underwrites treating parameter-perturbation sensitivity (Marder-style: chronic compensation
potential plus acute robustness) as a multi-objective dimension alongside fitness to target
tuning curves. It also justifies the projects choice to model the direction-selective retinal
ganglion cell as a *family* of acceptable parameter sets rather than a single canonical model,
and motivates reporting solution-manifold properties (spread, co-variation structure) in
addition to Pareto fronts. Together with Prinz, Bucher and Marder (2004), it forms the
conceptual foundation for the robustness-objective recipe in the t0097 catalogue.

London and Hausser (2005) wrote the canonical review of dendritic computation: a structured
synthesis of roughly four decades of theoretical and experimental work on how single neurons
use their dendritic structure, voltage-gated ion channels, and nonlinear synaptic conductances
to perform elementary computations. The review organises the literature around three
biophysical axes (passive cable properties, active ion-channel-mediated nonlinearities, and
synaptic-placement-dependent summation) and links each to specific computational primitives
such as coincidence detection, multiplicative gain, branch-level AND-gates, and direction
selectivity.

The central synthesis is that dendritic integration is never purely linear: the same synaptic
input pattern produces linear, sublinear, or supralinear summation depending on three factors:
(1) spatial clustering of inputs (same vs different dendritic branches), (2) temporal
coincidence (within a few to tens of milliseconds), and (3) membrane state (resting,
depolarized, or post-spike). Nonlinearities are produced by NMDA spikes (approximately 4-8
clustered spines threshold, 150-300% supralinear boost), dendritic sodium spikes
(Stuart-Sakmann 1994), and calcium plateaus (Larkum 1999, approximately 30-50 ms duration),
and can be gated off by strategically placed shunting inhibition (Koch, Poggio and Torre
1982).

The review explicitly treats retinal direction selectivity as a paradigmatic example of
dendritic computation in action: the Koch-Poggio-Torre shunting mechanism, validated
experimentally in rabbit DSGCs by Taylor 2000, demonstrates that a classical dendritic
nonlinearity (asymmetric shunting inhibition) is sufficient to implement a behaviorally
relevant computation (motion direction selectivity). The review argues that comparable
computational primitives exist in pyramidal and cerebellar neurons, unified by the three-axis
framework.

For the DSGC modelling programme this review is indispensable. It provides (a) the taxonomy
within which DSGC-specific mechanisms should be placed, (b) the quantitative cross-cell-type
reference numbers (electrotonic length ranges, NMDA-spike thresholds, shunting-inhibition
effect sizes) that calibrate DSGC models against the broader literature, and (c) the
experimental-design template (ablate one nonlinearity at a time, measure change in behavior)
that DSGC simulations should follow. Specifically, any DSGC model should be analysed under
systematic ablation of each of the five dendritic primitives (cable filtering, NMDA
supralinearity, Na+ spikes, Ca2+ plateaus, shunting asymmetry) to report which are necessary
and which are sufficient for DS.

Polsky, Mel and Schiller (2004) test a core prediction of the two-layer model of
pyramidal-cell computation: that thin basal and apical oblique dendrites function as
independent sigmoidal integrative subunits whose outputs sum at the soma. Using two-photon
glutamate uncaging at pairs of spatially precise sites, they compare measured paired EPSPs to
the linear sum of individual-site responses.

The experimental design varies the spatial configuration of the two uncaged sites: either on
the same thin dendrite (same-branch) or on two different thin dendrites (different-branch).
NMDA-spike involvement is tested with APV. Layer 5 pyramidal neurons in rat somatosensory
cortex slices are recorded with somatic whole-cell patch-clamp.

Same-branch paired inputs produce somatic EPSPs 150-300% of the linear prediction, reflecting
supralinear dendritic integration. Different-branch pairs sum within ~5% of the linear
prediction. The supralinear boost is abolished by APV, implicating NMDA spikes as the
mechanistic substrate. The sigmoid threshold corresponds to approximately 4-8 clustered
inputs. The effect generalises across distal and proximal thin dendrites.

For DSGC modelling this paper is the mechanistic template for a dendritic-sector
supralinear-integration hypothesis: if starburst-amacrine-cell (SAC) inhibition selectively
gates dendritic sectors during null-direction motion while allowing preferred-direction
bipolar inputs to cluster onto individual DSGC dendrites, the resulting supralinear boost
could contribute to direction selectivity. Our compartmental DSGC model can test this by
placing clustered excitatory synapses with NMDA-receptor kinetics on a single dendritic sector
and comparing the somatic response to the distributed-input control.

Tukker, Taylor, and Smith address a specific puzzle raised by Euler et al. (2002): SBAC
dendritic tips show direction-selective calcium signals even with GABAa/c blocked, so where
does the DS come from? The authors hypothesize that the answer is geometry. Their scope is a
passive, excitatory-only SBAC with realistic or parameterizable morphology; their motivation
is that the SBAC is the dominant source of directional inhibition onto DSGCs, so explaining
SBAC DS bounds the morphology-to-DSGC mapping.

The method is a full Neuron-C compartmental simulation built on two digitized rabbit SBACs and
a procedural artificial-morphology generator, driven by a semirandom bipolar array (200-300
synapses) with physiological cone and synaptic dynamics. They systematically manipulate
independent geometric variables — first-branch distance, distal branching density,
dendritic-tree radius, electrotonic length constant, compartment resolution, and per-dendrite
length variability — and read out DSI at 16 dendritic tips and the soma for bars, spots,
annuli, and gratings. An optional Q-type Ca2+ channel layer provides the voltage-to-release
amplification step.

The headline findings are that (a) morphology alone generates DSI ~ 0.2 at dendritic tips for
bars and DSI up to ~0.9 for gratings; (b) the mechanism is the direction-dependent summation
of a local tip-EPSP with a soma-mediated global EPSP, with optimal electrotonic length ~
dendritic spread; (c) DS is surprisingly robust to branching detail but sensitive to distal
synapse count and to symmetry-breaking in dendritic length; and (d) a Ca2+-channel threshold
can amplify the voltage DSI roughly threefold in intracellular calcium concentration.

For this project, Tukker 2004 is the canonical starting point for morphology as a causal
variable for DS. It fits the inclusion criteria with the caveat that the cell modeled is the
SBAC rather than the DSGC itself (borderline — flagged in Overview). Its artificial-morphology
methodology, DSI definition, and local-global summation framing should be treated as reference
points when comparing to downstream DSGC-centric modeling work, and its demonstration that
passive-only, inhibition-free morphology can yield strong DS establishes the baseline any more
complex retinal DS model must improve upon.

Prinz, Bucher and Marder ask how tightly neuronal properties and synaptic strengths must be
tuned to produce a specific network output. They focus on the crustacean pyloric rhythm
because its connectivity, neurons, and motor pattern are unusually well characterised. The
motivation is to test the implicit assumption underlying much of neurophysiology, that
animal-to-animal variability is "experimental noise" rather than a structural feature of the
nervous system. The hypothesis is that, just as similar single-neuron firing can arise from
many channel-density combinations, similar network output can arise from many cellular and
synaptic parameter combinations.

Methodologically, they enumerate 20,250,000 three-neuron model networks built from a 16-neuron
pool selected from a prior 1.7-million-neuron STG database, varying seven synaptic
conductances across five or six values. Each network is simulated, auto-classified, and tested
against 15 burst-timing features measured from 99 Homarus americanus pyloric recordings. The
model uses standard Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics with eight membrane currents per cell and
Abbott-Marder synapse kinetics. The full simulation ran for several months on a Beowulf
cluster of 1.2-GHz processors and produced approximately 4 GB of classification output.

The headline finding is that 2.2% (452,516) of all networks satisfy the strict 15-feature
pyloric criterion, every cell-combination is represented in this set, and six of the seven
synaptic conductances span the full 0-100 nS range. Only LP-to-PY is tightly constrained (>3
nS in just 0.1% of pyloric networks), matching its weak biological strength. Networks with
conductances differing by factors of three or more produce visually indistinguishable rhythms.
Burst period is controlled mainly by the AB/PD pacemaker identity, while LP and PY identity is
essentially free.

For the t0097 multi-objective optimization catalogue this paper anchors the biological
plausibility and degeneracy objective. It directly motivates: (i) treating the optimization
output as a Pareto manifold rather than a point, (ii) using multi-feature biological
acceptance criteria with explicit mean +/- 2 s.d. bands instead of single-objective fitting,
(iii) reporting which conductances remain unconstrained and which are tightly bottlenecked
across the Pareto front, and (iv) interpreting variability across the recovered solution set
as a biologically meaningful prediction about animal-to-animal heterogeneity in
direction-selective retinal ganglion cells, not as optimization noise. Combined with the
Marder-Goaillard 2006 review (already in this task as nrn1949), Prinz2004 grounds the t0097
robustness analysis in the canonical "many disparate parameter sets, one functional output"
result.

Khaliq, Gouwens, and Raman (2003) ask whether and how the resurgent component of NaV1.6 sodium
current promotes high-frequency action-potential firing in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. The
question matters because resurgent current - sodium current that flows when the channel exits
an open-channel-block state during repolarisation - is a peculiar, structurally distinctive
feature of NaV1.6 that had been correlated with rapid firing but never causally attributed to
it. The authors scope is somatic firing in dissociated Purkinje cells from wild-type and
Scn8a-med mice; they hold dendrites and synaptic input out of the analysis to focus on
intrinsic excitability.

Methodologically, the paper combines whole-cell current-clamp action-potential recordings from
acutely dissociated Purkinje somata with voltage-clamped pharmacological isolation of seven
non-sodium currents (Kfast, Kmid, Kslow, BK, Pca, Ih, leak) and a NEURON-based
single-compartment model that integrates these seven currents with an explicit Raman-Bean
state-machine model of NaV1.6 sodium current. The med phenotype - which lacks NaV1.6 and
therefore has 90 percent reduced resurgent current - is used as a natural knockout. The model
is validated by reproducing wild-type spontaneous firing at 27 spikes/sec (matching the 29 Hz
experimental mean) and is then used to ask which of the changes seen in med cells (lost
resurgent current, modified Kfast V1/2, reduced leak) actually drive the slower firing.

The headline finding is that resurgent kinetics specifically and consistently accelerate
firing. Med cells fired at 9 +/- 2 Hz spontaneously vs 35 +/- 4 Hz wild-type, and at 13 +/- 5
vs 65 +/- 7 spikes/sec under 50 pA injection, a deficit that survived even strong current
injection (maximum sustained rate 65 +/- 10 spikes/sec med vs 107 +/- 6 wild-type). Crucially,
the model showed that the small Kfast V1/2 shift and reduced leak found in med cells would, if
anything, **speed** firing \- so the observed slowdown must come from the sodium-channel
kinetics. Replacing wild-type with med-like Na kinetics in the model slowed simulated firing
by 19-31 percent, reproducing the experimental phenotype.

For the present project this paper is the kinetic foundation of the BedB substrate
voltage-gated channel library. The bkpkj.mod calcium-activated K channel and the NaR resurgent
sodium mod-file vendored in t0074 trace directly to this paper Equation-1 state model and
Table 1 parameter set. For t0078 specifically, the AIS-tiered NaR optimization treats this
paper kinetic schemes as the fixed scaffold and varies only channel density per tier - so any
biological plausibility argument about NaR density gradients ultimately rests on the parameter
ranges established here. The paper 19 pF single-compartment geometry also provides a minimal
regression-test target: vendored mod-files should reproduce ~27 Hz spontaneous firing in that
geometry before being deployed on the multi-compartment DSGC substrate.

Chklovskii, Schikorski, and Stevens (2002) ask why cortical gray matter has the cellular
composition that it does. Earlier work in the wiring-economy tradition (Cajal; Cherniak;
Mitchison; Chklovskii and Stevens 2000) had argued qualitatively that wire length is minimised
under selection pressure, but these arguments did not predict any quantitative property of
cortical anatomy that could be falsified by direct measurement. The paper closes this gap by
recasting the problem as a constrained optimisation: maximise synapse density subject to
bounded axonal conduction delay and bounded passive dendritic attenuation, with axon and
dendrite radii as the free variables.

The methodological contribution is a parameter-free derivation. After applying the standard
cable scalings (delay proportional to length over root radius; space constant proportional to
root radius), the species-specific membrane and axial constants cancel in the optimum, leaving
a pure geometric prediction: axons plus dendrites should fill exactly 3/5 of the gray-matter
volume at the optimum. The authors then test this with serial-section electron microscopy of
mouse hippocampal CA1 neuropil, measuring the volume fraction occupied by each cellular
component, and report agreement with the 3/5 prediction.

The headline finding is therefore a quantitative confirmation of the wiring-economy principle
as a real biological selection pressure operating on cortical morphology, not merely a
qualitative heuristic. This is one of the most cited results in computational neuroanatomy
because it demonstrates that an optimisation principle, applied with explicit biophysical
constraints, can predict an a-priori property of a real cortical tissue volume to within
experimental error. Later work has extended the framework to dendritic branching morphology
(Cuntz et al. 2010), to cortical GABAergic interneurons (Budd and Kisvarday 2012), and to
whole-brain connectomes.

For the t0097 multi-objective DSGC optimisation catalogue, this paper provides the
foundational biological justification for adding a cytoplasm-volume / wiring-cost objective
alongside functional DSGC objectives (direction-selectivity index, EPSP fidelity, robustness).
The 3/5 result tells us that real cortical neurons sit close to a wiring optimum, so a DSGC
morphology that drifts very far from the natural cytoplasm volume in our optimisation is
biologically suspect even if it yields a high DSI. Together with Cuntz et al. (2010), this
paper anchors the "minimise total cytoplasm volume" recipe that the catalogue should adopt;
deviations from the optimal volume can be reported as a quantitative biological-plausibility
metric. The main caveat for our use is that the original Chklovskii et al. analysis is for
cortical gray matter, not retinal inner plexiform layer, so the exact 3/5 fraction may not
transfer numerically to DSGC dendritic arbours - but the underlying recipe (wire cost + delay
+ attenuation) is general and is what we should adopt.

Single, Haag, and Borst (1997) address one of the oldest questions in invertebrate visual
neuroscience: where, along the chain from photoreceptor to wide-field motion-sensitive cell,
is direction selectivity generated? The prevailing assumption had been that the elementary
motion detectors (EMDs) feeding lobula plate tangential cells were themselves strongly
direction-tuned and that the large LPTC dendrite served primarily as a spatial integrator. The
authors set out to test this assumption directly by combining pharmacology with a
biophysically grounded compartmental model of a reconstructed VS-cell from the blowfly
Calliphora erythrocephala.

They use picrotoxinin to block GABAergic inhibition in vivo while recording intracellularly
from VS- and CH-cells and extracellularly from the H1 neuron. In parallel, they build a
passive compartmental model (Rm = 2 kOhm.cm^2, Ri = 40 Ohm.cm, Cm = 0.8 uF/cm^2) in which 32
opponent excitatory-inhibitory EMD synapses are distributed over four dendritic regions along
the main dendrite. An isopotential reduction yields the closed-form saturation expression Ee
(1 - c) / (1 + c), with c = gi/ge a velocity-dependent opponent ratio, clarifying how a single
synaptic machinery can underlie two ostensibly distinct phenomena.

The key findings are that (i) motion-induced input resistance drops by about 13-14 percent in
both directions under control, implying simultaneous excitatory-inhibitory activation; (ii)
PTX reduces this change to less than 50 percent (null) and about 60 percent (preferred) of
control and flips null-direction responses from hyperpolarization to depolarization, revealing
that the underlying EMDs are only weakly directionally tuned; and (iii) the passive
compartmental model, with weakly tuned EMDs, quantitatively reproduces the classical size- and
velocity-dependent saturation ("gain control"), which is abolished once inhibition is blocked.
Direction selectivity and gain control therefore share a single dendritic mechanism.

For this project's literature survey on how morphology shapes direction selectivity via
computational modeling, Single et al. (1997) is the foundational LPTC entry: it is the first
reconstructed-morphology compartmental model of a fly tangential cell, it fixes the passive-
dendrite "null model" against which morphology-manipulation experiments must be read, and it
establishes the opponent-conductance mechanism that any subsequent morphology-to-DSI
regression in the HS-VS literature inherits. The paper's main limitation for our purposes is
that dendritic morphology is held fixed — it is a same-morphology, varied-synapse study — so
it sets the stage for, rather than directly implements, explicit morphology-variation
experiments on DSI. It is invertebrate (fly, Calliphora erythrocephala), a flag to bear in
mind when generalizing to vertebrate retinal-ganglion or cortical DS models.

This paper describes the NEURON simulation environment, a domain-specific software system for
building biophysically detailed compartmental models of individual neurons and small networks.
It motivates the work by the inadequacy of generic ODE solvers for problems with branched
cable geometry, multiple voltage- and ligand-gated ionic currents, and spatially nonuniform
membrane potential. The scope is deliberately broad — from single-compartment HH models
through reconstructed dendritic trees with thousands of compartments — and the paper positions
NEURON as the tool that lets modelers focus on biophysics rather than on numerics.

Methodologically, NEURON rests on four design choices: (1) a two-level data model separating
anatomical `sections` from numerical `segments`; (2) an O(N) Gaussian elimination for the
branched cable matrix; (3) a staggered-time-step second-order integration scheme that is as
cheap per step as backward Euler; and (4) NMODL, a DSL for specifying membrane mechanisms that
is translated to C and dynamically linked into the simulator. The top-level interface is the
hoc interpreter with an InterViews-based GUI for interactive debugging.

The headline results are qualitative — the paper shows that the combined system can simulate
morphologically reconstructed neurons with detailed ion-channel biophysics at usable
wall-clock speeds on 1990s hardware, and that adding new channel types requires only an NMODL
file. The O(N) solver and the staggered Crank-Nicolson integrator are each presented with
mathematical justification and are the numerical innovations that make the system performant.
No quantitative benchmark table is given, but subsequent decades of published models establish
that the framework achieves its design goals.

For this project's literature survey on compartmental DSGC (direction-selective ganglion cell)
models, this paper is foundational infrastructure rather than a direct scientific antecedent.
Virtually every compartmental DSGC model in the literature is written against the abstractions
introduced here — sections, segments, NMODL mechanisms, hoc scripts. Understanding the
section/segment distinction, the role of `nseg`, and the NMODL toolchain is a prerequisite for
reading, replicating, and critiquing those models. The paper also defines the numerical
methods whose accuracy limits (first-order backward Euler, fixed-timestep analytical gating
updates) set the floor for how faithfully any DSGC compartmental model can reproduce fast
dendritic transients.
