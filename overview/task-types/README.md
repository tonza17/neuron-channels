earlier completed-task outputs. Typical outputs are correction files, and sometimes
replacement assets created in the current task and referenced by those corrections. The
default optional step list is empty because many correction tasks are straightforward, but the
execute-task orchestrator may still add research or planning when the correction request is
complex.

reading documentation, forums, blog posts, and other online resources. The output is typically
a structured research document, not code or datasets. This type is appropriate when the task
goal is knowledge gathering rather than asset production. Examples include investigating API
capabilities, comparing tool options, or understanding a technology landscape.

topic. Unlike download-paper tasks which target specific known papers, literature surveys cast
a wide net to discover papers across a research area. The output is a collection of paper
assets plus a synthesis document. Examples include surveying recent approaches to a problem,
collecting papers on a new technique, or mapping a research landscape.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Write Library</strong> (<code>write-library</code>)</summary>

code/ directory and is referenced via module_paths in the library asset. Examples include
building a data loader, creating an evaluation scorer, or implementing shared preprocessing
utilities.
