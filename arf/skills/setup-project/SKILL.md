  One-shot interactive onboarding for a newly forked Glite ARF template. Shows
  the safety acknowledgement, installs dependencies, runs doctor.py, then
  chains into create-project-description and the four meta/ sub-skills. Use
  once per fork, right after cloning.

# Setup Project

**Version**: 2

## Goal

Take a freshly forked Glite ARF repository from clone to ready-to-run-first-task through a single
interactive dialogue: capture the safety acknowledgement, install dependencies, validate the
environment, guide project description and budget creation, and populate `meta/` with the project's
categories, metrics, task types, and any extra asset types.

## Inputs

* `$ARGUMENTS` — ignored. The skill always runs the same workflow.

## Context

Read before starting:

* `arf/docs/explanation/safety.md` — autonomy and safety document quoted verbatim in Phase 1.
* `README.md` "Bootstrap a new project" section — the manual flow this skill replaces.
* `arf/specifications/project_description_specification.md` — required for Phase 3 verification.
* `arf/specifications/project_budget_specification.md` — required for Phase 3 verification.
* `arf/skills/create-project-description/SKILL.md` — the skill chained in Phase 3.
* `arf/skills/add-category/SKILL.md`, `arf/skills/add-metric/SKILL.md`,
  `arf/skills/add-task-type/SKILL.md`, `arf/skills/add-asset-type/SKILL.md` — chained in Phase 4.
* `arf/styleguide/agent_instructions_styleguide.md` — governs how this skill is written.
* `doctor.py` — the environment validator run in Phase 2.

## Steps

### Phase 1: Safety acknowledgement

1. Read `arf/docs/explanation/safety.md` and print a **summary** to the user with exactly these five
   bullet points, each in one sentence:
   * Shell and filesystem access in task worktrees
   * Git commits and pushes on the user's behalf
   * Paid LLM API usage that can cost tens to hundreds of dollars
   * Remote GPU provisioning on vast.ai that costs real money per minute
   * Prompt injection from downloaded papers and web content
2. Immediately after the summary, print the full text of `arf/docs/explanation/safety.md` inline so
   the user can read the complete document without leaving the session.
3. Ask exactly: "Type `I understand and accept these risks` to proceed, or anything else to cancel."
   Wait for the user's input.
4. If the user's reply is not the exact string `I understand and accept these risks` (case and
   punctuation included), print `Setup cancelled. Re-run /setup-project when ready.` and exit
   without touching any files.

### Phase 2: Environment preparation

5. Confirm the repository looks like a fresh fork: `project/` does not exist or is empty,
   `meta/categories/` has no subdirectories, `meta/metrics/` has no subdirectories. If any of those
   checks fail, print what was found and ask: "This repo has existing project configuration. Type
   `continue anyway` to overwrite it or anything else to cancel." Only proceed on the exact string
   `continue anyway`.

6. Ensure `uv` is installed:
   * Run `uv --version`. If it exits `0`, move on.
   * If `uv` is missing, propose the official Astral installer:
     * macOS or Linux → `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
     * Windows (PowerShell) →
       `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`
   * Show the exact command and ask: "Install uv with `<command>`? Type `yes` to run it or anything
     else to cancel." Run the command only on the exact string `yes`. On anything else, print the
     manual install instructions from <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/> and exit so the user can install
     it themselves, then re-run `/setup-project`.
   * After install, confirm `uv --version` now exits `0`. If not, exit with
     `uv install did not register on PATH. Open a new shell and re-run /setup-project.`

7. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

8. Install pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

9. Ensure git LFS is installed and configured:
   * Run `git lfs version`. If it exits `0`, run `git lfs install` and move on.
   * If `git lfs` is missing, detect the platform with `uname -s`:
     * `Darwin` → propose `brew install git-lfs`
     * `Linux` (check `/etc/os-release` for `ID=ubuntu` or `ID=debian`) → propose
       `sudo apt-get install -y git-lfs`
     * Any other platform → print the manual instructions from <https://git-lfs.com/> and exit with
       `Install git-lfs manually, then re-run /setup-project.`
   * Show the user the exact command and ask: "Install git-lfs with `<command>`? Type `yes` to run
     it or anything else to cancel." Run the command only on the exact string `yes`.
   * After install, run `git lfs install` to register hooks.

10. Ensure `direnv` trusts the repo's `.envrc`:
    * If `.envrc` does not exist in the repo root, skip this step.
    * Run `direnv status 2>&1`. If the output contains `Found RC allowed 1`, the file is already
      trusted — move on.
    * If `direnv` is not installed (`command -v direnv` fails), tell the user that `doctor.py` will
      block on this, point them at `brew install direnv` on macOS or
      `sudo apt-get install -y direnv` on Debian/Ubuntu, remind them to add the shell hook per
      <https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html>, and exit so they can install it themselves.
    * If the `.envrc` is not allowed, ask: "Allow direnv to load this repo's `.envrc`? This lets
      direnv activate the project's virtualenv automatically. Type `yes` to run `direnv allow` or
      anything else to cancel." Run `direnv allow` only on the exact string `yes`. On cancel, print
      `doctor.py will block until you run direnv allow manually.` and exit.

11. Run `python3 doctor.py` and surface its output verbatim to the user. If `doctor.py` reports any
    blocker (non-zero exit), print `Fix the blockers above and re-run /setup-project.` and exit. Do
    not proceed to Phase 3.

### Phase 3: Project description and budget

12. Invoke the `create-project-description` skill by printing a short notice such as "Next, I will
    run /create-project-description to create project/description.md and project/budget.json. Press
    enter to continue." and waiting for the user. Then delegate the entire dialogue to that skill —
    do not ask its questions here.

13. After `create-project-description` returns, confirm both files exist:

    ```bash
    uv run python -u -m arf.scripts.verificators.verify_project_description
    uv run python -u -m arf.scripts.verificators.verify_project_budget
    ```

    If either verificator reports errors, stop and tell the user to re-run
    `/create-project-description` to fix them before continuing.

### Phase 4: Customize meta/

14. Read `project/description.md` into context so subsequent sub-skills inherit it.

15. For each of the four sub-skills below, in this order:
    * Print `Running /<skill-name> to populate meta/<area>/.`
    * Invoke the sub-skill with `project/description.md` as its argument.
    * When the sub-skill returns, print the count of entries that were added.

    Sub-skills to invoke, in order:
    * `/add-category project/description.md`
    * `/add-metric project/description.md`
    * `/add-task-type project/description.md`
    * `/add-asset-type project/description.md`

### Phase 5: Wrap-up

16. Print a summary to the user with:
    * The number of entries added in each of `meta/categories/`, `meta/metrics/`,
      `meta/task_types/`, `meta/asset_types/`.
    * The list of files now present under `project/`.
    * The exact next command:
      `Run /create-task to create your first task. See arf/docs/tutorial/ for the full walkthrough.`

## Done When

* The user typed the exact acknowledgement phrase in Phase 1.
* `uv sync`, `uv run pre-commit install`, and `python3 doctor.py` all completed successfully, or the
  skill exited cleanly after telling the user which blocker to fix.
* Either `git lfs install` ran successfully, or the user declined the install prompt and the skill
  exited with manual install instructions.
* `project/description.md` exists and passes `verify_project_description`.
* `project/budget.json` exists and passes `verify_project_budget`.
* Each of `/add-category`, `/add-metric`, `/add-task-type`, `/add-asset-type` was invoked and the
  user saw its result.
* The wrap-up summary was printed with the `/create-task` pointer.

## Forbidden

* NEVER proceed past Phase 1 without the exact acknowledgement string. Any other reply ends the
  skill.
* NEVER skip `python3 doctor.py`. Blockers must be surfaced to the user.
* NEVER write anything to `meta/` directly from this skill. Delegate to the sub-skills.
* NEVER run a system package manager (`brew`, `apt-get`, etc.) without showing the exact command and
  getting the explicit `yes` confirmation in the same turn.
* NEVER create a `tasks/tXXXX_*` folder as part of setup. See `CLAUDE.md` rule 0.
